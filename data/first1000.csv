Elijah Blake,"No, no
I ain't ever trapped out the bando
But oh Lord, don't get me wrong
I know a couple niggas that do
I'm from a place where everybody knows your name
They say I gotta watch my attitude
When they see money, man they all start actin' strange
So fuck with the ones that fuck with you
They can never say I'm brand new

It's everyday, everyday
Everyday, everyday, everyday
Everyday, everyday
Everyday, everyday
I've been talkin' my shit, nigga that's regular
I've been lovin' 'em thick, life is spectacular
I spend like I'ma die rich, nigga I'm flexin', yeah
Everyday, that's everyday
That's everyday
That's everyday
That's everyday, everyday

I see all of these wanna-be hot R&B singers
I swear you all sound the same
They start from the bottom, so far from the motto
You niggas'll never be Drake
Shout out to OVO
Most of them prolly don't know me though
I stay in the cut, I don't fuck with no
Body but I D, that's a pun on No I.D
When nobody know my name
Runnin' for my dream wasn't hard to do
You break bread, I swear they all pull out a plate
Eat with the ones who starved with you
If I'm winnin' then my crew can't lose

It's everyday, everyday
Everyday, everyday, everyday
Everyday, everyday
Everyday, everyday
I've been talkin' my shit, nigga that's regular

Everyday, that's everyday
That's everyday
That's everyday
That's everyday, everyday

I heard since you got money
You changed, you're actin' funny
That's why I gets on my lonely
You be lovin' when change is a hobby
Who do you dress when you ain't got nobody?

It's everyday, everyday
Everyday, everyday, everyday

Elijah Blake,"The drinks go down and smoke goes up, I feel myself, got to let go
My cares get lost up in that crowd that go up, up and away yo

Slow down the lights, eyes open wide
We live till we die, live till we die, live till we die

Ain't kill my vibe, don't blow my high, don't doubt that he from the band though
I'm listening to this song, now I'm up up and away yo

Nights like this, I go all out, up so high, I can't come down
Let me live just for right now
Yeah, yeah, bite me, I'm so gone

Happier than a motherfucker, I can't feel my fa-ace
No squares in my circle, get up out my way
Happier than a motherfucker, I can't feel my fa-ace
Who you tryna dance? Get up out my way
Happier than a motherfucker, I can't feel my fa-ace
No squares in my circle, get up out my way
Happier than a motherfucker, I can't feel my fa-ace
Who you tryna dance? Get up out my way

When I'm out at night, I chase neon lights
All of my thoughts start to echo, yeah they start to echo

Slow down the lights, eyes open wide
We live till we die, live till we die, live till we die

So I'ma roll the dice, and I hope that I
Don't take more than I can handle, much than I can handle

Elijah Blake,"She don't live on planet Earth no more
She found love on Venus, that's her word
Said she needed space, time to explore
Now she movin' on and on and on and on

Is it might fault that you're broken, is it my fault that your'e high?
You caught me cheating with my ex-girlfriend, but instead of calling me I caught her

I was like ""man, oh shit, my new girl fuckin' with my old chick""
We both bad, so she switched, packed her bags, said she had to take a trip
To the otherside, the otherside, the otherside
She's gone, she's gone, she's gone, to the otherside

Can we get back to how it was before?
If I can't have you, at least show me what's in store
And what I've made is [?] come forward more
Then we can go on and on and on and on

Trippin' off that Grigio, mobbin', lights low

Baby I'm surprised you picked up this late at night
And I'm not tryna start a fight
But I hate the way we ended and the fact you got me cheated
I hate these new beginnings even though I am the reason
The only thing I love right now is you

I miss ya going through my phone
And calling up the numbers you don't know
The make up sex, even when it's wrong
Our love was that strong

[Hook 1]
I'm just trippin' off that Grigio
It sucks to see that you don't feel me though
Pour me a glass and let my feelings blow

Aw baby, aw baby, I ain't no drinker but it's gettin' me though

I don't know why your father never like me
Was it because of my [?]boy ways and this white tee? Your eye
Always thought your momma was a winner
Considering her only stayed together after all those years
You think that we could learn from them

I miss ya going through my phone
And calling up the numbers you don't know
The make up sex, even when it's wrong
Our love was that strong

Nights like this, we should be trippin' off that Grigio
Telling me secrets that nobody knows
Pour us a shot and cut the music on

I found, I found the answers in the thunder and the rain
You made a promise that you would never leave me alone

I see a fresh a cut diamond, coal minor's are dirty and cruel

When you smile slightly crooked
That's your style, don't you fix it
Girl you got a hold on me
Don't wanna play no games, this is do or die
And I don't mind if you get comfortable and gain a little weight
'Cause you're so fine, and just like whine you get a little better everyday

You're the only one, you're the only one
You're the only one, you're the only one

Elijah Levi,"Lullaby of Birdland, that's what I 
Always hear when you sigh
Never in my wordland 
Could there be ways to reveal
In a phrase how I feel

Have you ever heard two turtle doves
Bill and coo when they love?
That's the kind of magic 
Music we make with our lips when we kiss

And there's a weepy old willow
He really knows how to cry
That's how I'd cry in my pillow
If you should tell me farewell and goodbye

Pulls that man around by her, if it wasn't for her and her

Silhouettes bring confidence and peace to me.
I'll only tell you what you'd know
From a careful glance or a greeting by chance,
Less I lose the romance
Of an altogether admirable man.

I have fashioned a marble image
Of everything I'd like you to see.
Without the things I hate about me.

This is all that I am.
I am all that I am.
If I accept this, I am free,
In mind, In body.

So don?t ask; I won't tell.
Just read the insert of the c.d. in the player
Because the player's got it figured out,
With all the hype and the hooks but the facts left.

Elio e le Storie Tese,"Quando ero piccolo tutti mi sherzavano
Per le dimensioni del mio pene, ed io non stavo bene.
Soffrivo le pene per colpa del pene, ma piÃ¹ il problema non si pone:
SÃ¬, perchÃ¨ il pene mi dÃ  il pane, son diventato un grande attore
E, benchÃ¨ schiavo dell'amore, mi son comprato una moto.
E ora son schiavo della moto, non faccio piÃ¹ moto,
Infatti vado solo in moto,
Ma ora sono diventato un mito:
Ho rilanciato il film muto
PerchÃ¨ sono muto,
E se vedrete il filmato sicuramente converrete con noi che questÃ  Ã¨ veritÃ .

E se fossi stato ceco
Avrei lanciato il film ceco
E se fossi stato m
Avrei lanciato il filmmm.

Elio e le Storie Tese,"When I was just a boy,
Everyone made fun of me,
Just because my penis was enormous,
My mom said it was gorgeous.

I work in a circus because of my penis,
And everybody says: â€œNo problem!â€,
Because my penis makes my living,
Now I became a famous actor,
And even though Iâ€™m just a slave to love,
I bought myself a rasta Harley.

Now Iâ€™m a slave to my new Harley
I got it from Bob Marley,
Itâ€™s rasta â€˜cause it was Bob Marleyâ€™s,
Sometimes I reggae with Ziggy Marley.

I will relaunch the silent movie
Because Bob told me that itâ€™s groovie,
And if you see that forty jumps of that children
We will act like: this is fondamentally the truth.

Twelve inches, itâ€™s one foot
Of artistic reality,
That is what attracted all the critics,
Not my acting ability,
Because they simply donâ€™t get it,
I donâ€™t speak â€˜cause I eat spaghetti,
And so my face is normally off-screen,
All of the people still come to adore me,
And now theyâ€™ve made me into a big style.

I relaunched the silent movie,
Because I am silent,
And even if I had been born dumb,
Iâ€™d have relaunched the dumb movie,
And if I had been born XXX
Iâ€™d have relaunched the XXX movie
I am your fire and your Venus,
Because Iâ€™m acting with my penis,
And so my penis makes my living,
My penis is very forgiving,
All my Harleys donâ€™t forgive me,
And Iâ€™m asking for forgiveness,
Yes yes my Harleys donâ€™t forgive me,

Betrayal, you betrayed me
You betrayed me with a kiss
I thought you were my friend
Now I hate you
So much
You betrayed me with a kiss
You never really cared
It turned out to be wrong
So wrong
Can you trust in your friend's words
Can he look into your eyes
Betrayal, you betrayed me
Discussing all the things with you
I told you all my secrets
You told it to the world
And laughed about it
I would have given anything
If you just asked me for
I was too good for you
Too good for you
Now I ask you
Why did it have to be like this
'Cause I miss you
Sometimes
Can you trust in your friend's words
Can he look into your eyes
Betrayal, you betrayed me
You betrayed me with a kiss
I thought you were my friend

Which has touched me right there in my heart

Besides chaos and smoking ruins

But never, never, again
 
Again, this couldn't happen again

What's more, this never happened before
Though I have prayed for a lifetime
That such as you would suddenly be mine
Mine to hold as I""m holding you now and yet never so near
Mine to have when the now and the here disappear

I need you baby

Don't bring me down I pray
Oh pretty baby

And let me love you, baby

I know there will always be more worth moving on for

Here she comes
You'd better watch your step
She's going to break your heart in two
It's true

It's not hard to realise
Just look into her false colored eyes
She'll build you up just to put you down
What a clown!

Everybody knows
The things she does to please
She's just a little tease
See the way she walks
Hear the way she talks

You're put down in her book
And you are number 37, have a look!
She's going to smile to make you frown
What a clown!

Little boy, she's from the street
So before you start you're already beat
She's going to play you for a fool
You can see it's true

Everybody knows the things
The things she does to please
She's just... just a little tease.. oh, she is just..
See the way she walks
Do you hear the way she talks?

Well your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you
And she tied you to her kitchen chair
She broke your throne and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the hallelujah

Baby I've been here before
I've seen this room and I've walked this floor
I used to live alone before I knew you
I've seen your flag on the marble arch

It's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah

Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah...

Well there was a time when you let me know
What's really going on below
But now you never show that to me do you
But remember when I moved in you
And the holy dove was moving too
And every breath we drew was hallelujah

Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah...

Well, maybe there is a God above
But all I've ever learnt from love
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew you
And it's not a cry that you hear at night
It's not somebody who's seen the light
It's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah

And that Iâ€™ll see the sun again

See how they twist & shout
Look fine, think twice
No wonder it seems pretty nice

Why nobody told me

And I crashed so sadly that I cried

See Iâ€™m not so weak, whatever you think
Can push and shove or give a slap, youâ€™d better watch your back!

I see you turning off the light
And I know that means that you might

My patterned flowered dress, looks like thereâ€™s going to be such a mess

Shuffling barefoot on the concrete
Still Iâ€™m asleep in the deep
Looks like it is such a funny trip 
Though artists almost ruined it

Whoâ€™s that boy riding on a bicycle
Dragging around his toy his girlâ€™s got the doll
Where are they going to? Obviously to the zoo
It sounds like a brilliant idea, letâ€™s follow them my dear!

Strings of pearls round my neck, Iâ€™m planting good words in your head
Now your hair has gone so wild, in blossomâ€™s better than having two legs!

it'll end in suicide
washed my hands and cried

Focussing on the pain 
Running through my veins
it will never end

Your eyes your hands 
I let go of them
You lips, I let go of your kiss

You say finally that you may need me 
It's not the way I wanted
the more I see you the more I'm defeated.

You're here and i'm tired
cause i thought it died
this feeling inside

You shot me in the brain
then make my heart beat again
it drives me insane

Think that i'm still in love with you
and now i don't know what to do

Your eyes your hands 
I let go of them
You lips, I let go of your kiss

You say finally that you may need me 
It's not the way I wanted
the more I see you the more I'm defeated.",Defeated [Album Version]
Elisa Tovati,"Longtemps je me suis couchÃ©e Ã  l'ouest
Et de ce fauteuil pullman qui me berce
J'observe ma bouche qui se reflÃ¨te
Sur le quai nocturne les gens en liesse
Et tous ces mouchoirs au bout de leurs gestes
C'est dÃ©jÃ  l'heure
L'orient express
Et le train dÃ©marre
Sâ€™Ã©loignent les promesses
Que moi je verse avec la tristesse
Je suis dans les vapeurs de toi
Je suis partie Ã  l'heure comme toi
J'attendrai les lueurs sans toi
Je suis dans les vapeurs
Voiture 3

Au pied des princesses
Des chiens en laisse
Et toutes ces beautÃ©s aux Ã©toffes Ã©paisses
Qu'ici les groles nomment des niÃ¨ces
Ni elles ni ces marchands de business
Ces gentlemans ces faiseurs d'ex
Ne m'Ã©garent de ma route
La perce
Maintenant prend de la vitesse

Orient express
Demain je me lÃ¨verai Ã  l'est
Je suis dans les vapeurs de toi
Je suis partie Ã  l'heure comme toi
J'attendrai les lueurs sans toi
Je suis dans les vapeurs
Cabine 23

Ne serait ce pas dans l'orient express
Immense diva dont parle la presse
Elle me tend du cristal plein d'ivresse
Je lui parle pas je me confesse
Je suis partie sans laisser d'adresse
Je suis dans les vapeurs de toi
Je suis partie Ã  l'heure comme toi
J'attendrai les lueurs sans toi

Mais nous sommes bloquÃ©s par les neiges
Il n'y a aucun bruit alentour
Aucune note aucun cortÃ¨ge
Nous sommes Ã  milles lieux des bateaux
Le convoi est pris dans les glaces
Je cherche un peu d'eau et ma place
Ca fait des nuits que je cherchais
Ce long nulle part ce grand silence
J'ai vu des hommes fleurir des prÃ¨s
Pour que leurs fils tentent leur chance
J'ai vu tant de ciels orageux
J'ai voyagÃ© sous tant de pluie

Et vous que cherchez vous
Et vous que cherchez vous

From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain:
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song
My heart would sing?

That beautiful rhapsody
Of love and youth and spring,
The music is sweet,
The words are true 
The song is you.",The Song Is You

I'll tell you no lie

How far would I travel
To be where you are?
How far is the journey
From here to a star?

And if I ever lost you, how much would I cry?
How deep is the ocean?
How high is the sky?

Elisabeth Welch,"My thoughts go back to a heavenly dance
A moment of bliss we spent
Our hearts were filled with a song of romance
As into the night we went
And sang to our hearts' content

The song is ended
But the melody lingers on
You and the song are gone
But the melody lingers on

The night was splendid
And the melody seemed to say
""Summer will pass away
Take your happiness while you may""

There 'neath the light of the moon
We sang a love song that ended too soon

And I found with the break of dawn
You and the song had gone

And the dear friends have to part?

Near the end of a journey too.

Elise Estrada,"You know, you know
You know that it's torture

The sweetest words you whisper in my ear
'Cause you know what I wanna hear
The way you hold me like it's something real
'Cause you know what I wanna feel

It takes two to lie
One to lie and one to listen
Empty promises are wearin' thin

Ohhh...

Stop
What you're doin' to me
Stop
Like an arrow through me
Stop
This is torture to me
'Cause it's gotta be all or it's nothing at all
I'm tellin' you to stop
This is torture to me
You know that it's torture

I lose control when you're touchin' me
'Cause you know what I really need
But I need more than physicality
So you know how it's gotta be

It takes two to lie
One to lie but I'm done listenin'
If you're heart's half in it then we're finished

Ohhh...

Stop
What you're doin' to me
Stop
Like an arrow through me
Stop
This is torture to me (Torture to me)
'Cause it's gotta be all or it's nothing at all
I'm tellin' you to stop
This is torture to me
You know that it's torture

Can't keep goin' through this
Can't keep on leadin' me on
Why you bein' so elusive?
You're in or you're out
There's no middle ground

Ohhh... no
It's killin' me, it's killin' me
You know that it's torture (This is torture)
It's killin' me, it's killin' me (It's killin' me)
You know that it's torture

I lose control when you're touchin' me
'Cause you know what I really need
But I need more than physicality

'Cause it's gotta be all or it's nothing at all (Nothing at all)
I'm tellin' you to stop

You know that it's torture

It's killin' me, it's killin' me
You know that it's torture (Know that it's torture)

Elise Estrada,"Unfair
Unreal
I wanna tell my heart it's a quick steal
That'd be one way
To unlove you

unjust
Unkind
That I can't you erase from my mind
That'd be another way
To unlove you

even though my heart
Is tellin me to stay, beggin me to stay
My self-respect is telling me
I gotta walk away, so

CHORUS
I'mma gonna say what I gotta say
What's done you can't undo
I'mma gonna break what I gotta break
Cause you were untrue
I'm gonna hurt
I'm gonna cry
I'm gonna tear me up inside
I'mma gonna do what I gotta do
To unlove you (to unlove you)

I heal
I wish that I could freeze every thing I feel
That'd be one way

If I could only turn me into stone
And that'd be, another way

I've gotta look you in the eye
And tell the world the biggest lie
What choice do I have
When you hurt me so bad
Wrecked everything we had
So

I'mma gonna say what I gotta say
I'mma gonna do what I gotta do
To unlove you

Elise Witt,"Volver a los diecisiete
DespuÃ©s de vivir un siglo
Es como descifrar signos
Sin ser sabio competente
Volver a ser de repente
Tan frÃ¡gil como un segundo
Volver a sentir profundo
Como un niÃ±o frente a Dios
Eso es lo que siento yo
En este instante fecundo

Se va enredando, enredando
Como en el muro la hiedra
Y va brotando, brotando
Como el musguito en la piedra
Ay sÃ­ sÃ­ sÃ­

Mi paso retrocedido
Cuando el de ustedes avanza
El arco de las alianzas
Ha penetrado en mi nido
Con todo su colorido
Se ha paseado por mis venas
Y hasta las duras cadenas
Con que nos ata el destino
Es como un diamante fino
Que alumbra mi alma serena

Lo que puede el sentimiento
No lo ha podido el saber
Ni el mÃ¡s claro proceder
Ni el mÃ¡s ancho pensamiento
Todo lo cambia el momento
Cual mago condescendiente
Nos aleja dulcemente
De rencores y violencias
Solo el amor con su ciencia
Nos vuelve tan inocentes

El amor es torbellino
De pureza original
Hasta el feroz animal
Susurra su dulce trino
Detiene a los peregrinos
Libera a los prisioneros
El amor con sus esmeros
Al viejo lo vuelve niÃ±o
Y al malo solo el cariÃ±o
Lo vuelve puro y sincero

De par en par en la ventana
Se abriÃ³ como por encanto
EntrÃ³ el amor con su manto
Como una tibia maÃ±ana
Al son de su bella diana
Hizo brotar el jazmÃ­n
Volando cual serafÃ­n
Al cielo le puso aretes
Y mis aÃ±os en diecisiete
Los convirtiÃ³ el querubÃ­n",Volver a Los Diecisiete
Ã‰lishia Sharie,"Sometimes we war with ourselves
Screaming from the pits of our own hells
Feeling like no one out there cares
Suffocating gasping for your air

Youâ€™re at the edge of the line
Will you wave your flag or fight
Donâ€™t hide now donâ€™t run for cover
What about all of the others
Youâ€™re fighting for you, and fighting for them

You gotta fight for your life
Because youâ€™re someone elseâ€™s light
You gotta fight for your life
Because youâ€™re someone elseâ€™s light
You gotta fight (Fight Fight Fight) (Fight for your life)
You betta fight (Fight Fight Fight) (Fight for your life)

Weâ€™re all infected with disease
Fading from our own disbelief
Fearing all that we are
Tortured and broken from all your battle scars

Youâ€™re at the edge of your mind
Will you wave your flag or fight
Donâ€™t hide now donâ€™t run for cover
What about your sisters and brothers
Youâ€™re fighting for you and fighting for them

You gotta fight for your life
Because youâ€™re someone elseâ€™s light
You gotta fight for your life
Because youâ€™re someone elseâ€™s light
You gotta fight (Fight Fight Fight) (Fight for your life)
You betta fight (Fight Fight Fight) (Fight for your life)

Weâ€™ve been cursed since birth and sent straight to work
Groomed to come in last and never in first
Time goes on it seemed to get worse
Mask all the hurt with a smile and a smirk
Damage that caused only God really knows
Seek the Most High to deal with these lows
Canâ€™t get a hold of my mind take control
I climbed from the bottom of the totem pole
Despite all the spite that was aimed at my life
Cards were dealt I got a hand that I like
I was handed a light at the end of the tunnel
Use to cry me a river now I only see a puddle
With life I rock and roll no more singing the blues
Turned up the claps and drowned out the boos
As long as I move thereâ€™s no way to lose
Havenâ€™t paid off my debt but I paid all my dues

You gotta fight for your life
Because youâ€™re someone elseâ€™s light
You gotta fight for your life
Because youâ€™re someone elseâ€™s light
You gotta fight (Fight Fight Fight) (Fight for your life)
You betta fight (Fight Fight Fight) (Fight for your life)

Fight for your dreams
Fight for your life
Fight for your dreams
Fight for your life
You betta fight
You betta fight

Elison Saxophone Quartet,"I've got sunshine on a cloudy day
When it's cold outside I've got the month of May

What can make me feel this way?
My girl (my girl, my girl)
Talkin' 'bout my girl (my girl)

I've got so much honey the bees envy me
I've got a sweeter song than the birds in the trees

Elissa,"You've played your game for too long 
I never thought you'd do this to me 
I'm thinking this was so wrong 
I only live with all that's dear and true to me 
You've hurt me for the last time 
When my heart mends, I find 
You always keep on haunting me 
Let go of the past 
Don't ever look back 
Is that the way it has to be 

Chorus: 
My love, set me free 
From all this hurt inside of me 
Someday, I will see 
If you will find your way right back to me 

You've played me too many times 
I can't believe your love wasn't true 
I trusted you with my heart 
And now there's nothing, I can do or say to you 
You've hurt me for the last time 
When my heart mends, I find 
You always keep on wanting me 
Let go of the past 
Don't ever look back 
Is that the way it has to be 

Chorus (2x) 

You've hurt me for the last time 
When my heart mends, I find 
You always keep on wanting me 
Let go of the past 
Don't ever look back 
Is that the way it has to be 

Chorus (2x)",Back to Me
Elissa,"There's no one who could ever
Love me like you love me
I remember how it used to be
There was no stronger love
And now I can't believe,
I was only too blind to see
That your love was inside of me
And now I don't have anything at all

Every night I think, as time just passes by
How I lived your love and how you made me cry
Now that I find I don't know what to do
My life is so empty, so empty alone without you

Without you, without you
I don't know what to do without you boy
Without you,
My love is in your hands
There's nothing left to live for
There's nothing left to do, without you

Every night that I sleep, I sleep with a fantasy
That you're here, its just you and me
Like it always was
But then I'm left to see that it was only a memory
And what's left is for me to be
Alone without your love",Without You

Why do I seek
I can love his body and I don't have to speak
Well I stood by his shoulder and I blew on his fave
In his eyes were the pastures of a much greener place

But I think that stitches will mend him
And his feet choose a path that they know
Looking from his bedroom window and falling in love

I've been found out, what's my mother gonna say

And the world was back to front
There was sunshine in the evenin'
And the moon came out for lunch

I wouldn't mind walkin' backwards with you
At least we'd always know where we'd be goin' to
We could talk till we forget how to talk

And we could learn to laugh again
Like when we were children
We could learn to dance again
Like nobody is watchin'

If everyone was gettin' young
There'd be a smile on your face
If all the friends that passed away
Came back to this place

We'd be puttin' down the daisies
Drinkin' milk and feelin' lazy
There's no sense in any senses
What's the use in independence?

We could play of the tears that came
We could walk till we forget how to walk
And cool till we forget anything at all

And we would laugh again
Like when we were children
We could learn to dance again
Like nobody is watchin'

We could learn to look right
Into each others eyes
'Cause we got nothin' to hide

We got nothin' but to laugh again
Like when we were children
Like when we were children

Will you come backwards with me
Backwards with me?

Of anybody checking their face,
In the shade of my glasses,

And I'm solo all the way.

To push away the trouble,
That sits in the pit of my tummy,
But I know that it will find me,
When I finish the last page.

I feel a tickle in my eye.

No I'll never, sever any time,
Tired of the journey, 
No hand held in mine,
No I'll never, sever any time,
Tired of the journey,
No hand held in mine.

Will I always feel it more,
On a day when there's a storm,
Or a raincloud, so dangerous and lonely,
No one ever told me,
That the darkness is my fault.

And I'm looking out the window,
And losing both my dimples,
As they enter the ends of my smile,
'Cause I am a thousand miles,
From the place I need to go.

And empty hand I wave goodbye,
I feel a tickle in my eye.

If you find me, find me, find me, find me

Because I'm missing how you found me
If anybody has a key to spare a little dream for me
I'll let it be
That you find me, find me, finally found me

When I fall nobody helps me up
And when I call nobody's pickin' up the phone
It seems they won't even throw me a bone
Stickin' my face on a lamppost

So if you see me in your favorite spot
Just remember I could give you a lot
'Cause I stray in whatever I do
All I need is somebody like you

Because I'm missing how you found me
I can't afford a bigger world but, baby, I'm reliable
I'll never go
If you find me, find me, find me, find me

Because I'm missing how you found me
If anybody has a key to spare a little dream for me
I'll let it be
That you find me, find me, finally found me

I gotta get up
I gotta get up
I gotta get up
I gotta get up

So when you see me in your favorite spot
Just remember I could give you a lot
I came to see you when there's no use pretendin'
Let's hope it's a happier ending

Because I'm missing, yeah, you'll find me
I can't afford a bigger world but, baby, I'm reliable
I'll never go
If you find me, find me, find me, find me

Because I'm missing and you'll find me
If anybody has a key to spare a little dream for me
I'll let it be
That you finally, finally, finally found me

And I wont ever know, so I take the time, 'cause it wont stop taking mine

I don't know what a winner is, but I want to be one. 
Would I ever really know, if I didn't get me some?

'Cause I found my way with bad directions
I've done my best, and I learned my lessons
And I know I can do this, again and again 
So, let it rain, just let it rain, just let it rain on me

What the signs are saying, over and over 
If you fear it, you should face it
But my fear has the face of you.

I want to make, make you proud
Those the only words, that I care, care about

I don't know what a winner is, but I want to be one. 
Would I ever really know, if I didn't get me some?

'Cause I found my way with bad directions
I've done my best, & I learned my lessons

So, let it rain, just let it rain, just let it rain on me

I see your face in the crowd
All I want to do is make you proud
And they can say what they want
Those are the only words that I care about
If I can't fight, I still stand,
So you can see who I am 
Come gather 'round, quiet down, do you hear that sound?

Just let it rain on me.
Just let it rain on me.
Just let it rain on me.
Just let it rain on me.

I know I can do this, again and again

Eliza Gilkyson,"Once there were greenfields kissed by the sun;
Once there were valleys where rivers used to run;
Once there was blue sky with white clouds high above;
Once they were part of an everlasting love.
We were the lovers who strolled through greenfields.

Greenfields are gone now, parched by the sun;
Gone from the valleys where rivers used to run;
Gone with the cold wind that swept into my heart;
Gone with the lovers who let their dreams depart.
Where are the greenfields that we used to roam?

I'll never know what made you run away.
How can I keep searching when dark clouds hide the day?
I only know there's nothing here for me,
Nothing in this wide world left for me to see.

But I'll keep on waitin' 'til you return.
I'll keep on waiting until the day you learn
You can't be happy while your heart's on the roam.
You can't be happy until you bring it home,
Home to the greenfields and me once again.",Greenfields

For all your words that flowed like wine
Roses at the end of time

Tonight I bless the hands of fate

Weary, worn and worth the wait
So willing to explore me

One for every tear you wept

One for every wrong repaired

All that he could see was Babylon.
Beautiful green fields and dreams,
And learn to measure the stars.

He said,
How could it come to this?
I'm really worried about living.
How could it come to this?
Yeah I really want to know about this.
Is it like today?

Then there came a day.
It moved out 'cross the Mediterranean.
Came to western isles and the freak young men.
And with their silver beards they laughed
At the unknown universe.
They could sit and guess God's name.

But they said,
How could it come to this?
We're really worried about living.
How could it come to this.
Yeah, we really want to know about this.
Is it like today?

But sometimes it was faith, power or reason as the cornerstone.
But the furrowed brow has never left his face.

How could it come to this?
We've been living in a landslide!
How could it come to this?
Yeah, we really want to know about this.

Flew off from the planet.
He went to the moon,
Now he's out in space,
Hey, fixing all the problems.
He comes face to face with God.

How could it come to this?

To justify the emptiness inside
No need to pray and turn for guidance to the Providence:
It simply won't provide.
No need to ask your friends 
For well-intentioned Good Advice

No need for subterfuge
I've all run out of insights
And inspiring things to say.
No need to worry so about me
'Cause you know
I'm landing on my feet 

A little late, but I'm complete.
I speak from the heart:
Please remember, I love you dearly
Although we have to part.
Please remember, I love you dearly
Although we have to part.",Goodbye Song

E vocÃª pra mim foi uma delas
Que no tempo em que eram belas viam tudo diferente do que Ã©
Agora que nÃ£o mais encanta, procura imitar a planta
As plantas que morrem de pÃ©
E eu lhe agradeÃ§o por de mim ter se lembrado
Dentre tanto desgraÃ§ado que em sua vida passou

Do things I never should do
I drink much more that I ought to drink

It's a yearnin' for my old back yard

Better swallow up my silly country pride

Down the Gasoline Alley where I started from

And the wind don't whistle 'round your knees

The days when I was young enough to know the truth

To only pass the time
No more coloring books,
No Christmas bells to chime
But thinking young and growing older is no sin
And I can play the game of life to win

I can recall a time,
When I wasn't afraid to reach out to a friend
And now I think I've got
A lot more than a skipping rope to lift

Now there's more to do
Than watch my sailboat glide
Then everyday can be my magic carpet ride
And I can play hide and seek with my fears,
And live my life instead of counting my years

Let everyone debate the true reality,
I'd rather see the world the way it used to be
A little bit of freedom, all we're left

Then you've left her to hunt a new game

That she's probably doing the same?

If you want to feel wretched and lonely and blue
Just imagine the girl you love best
In the arms of some fellow who's stealing a kiss
From the lips that you once fondly pressed

But the world moves apace and the loves of today
Flit away with a smile and a tear
So you can never tell who's kissing her now
Or just whom you'll be kissing next year

I wonder who's kissing her now
I wonder who's teaching her how
I wonder who's looking into her eyes

If you wake up and don't want to smile,
If it takes just a little while,
Open your eyes and look at the day,
You'll see things in a different way.

Don't stop, thinking about tomorrow,
Don't stop, it'll soon be here,
It'll be, better than before,
Yesterday's gone, yesterday's gone.

Don't stop! Don't stop!

Why not think about times to come,
And not about the things that you've done,
If your life was bad to you,
Just think what tomorrow will do.

Don't stop, thinking about tomorrow,
Don't stop, it'll soon be here,
It'll be, better than before,
Yesterday's gone, yesterday's gone.

Don't stop! Don't stop!

All I want is to see you smile,
If it takes just a little while,
I know you don't believe that it's true,
I never meant any harm to you.

Don't stop, thinking about tomorrow,
Don't stop, it'll soon be here,
It'll be, better than before,
Yesterday's gone, yesterday's gone.

Don't stop, thinking about tomorrow,
Don't stop, it'll soon be here,
It'll be, better than before,
Yesterday's gone, yesterday's gone.

Don't you look back,
Don't you look back,
Don't you look back,
Don't you look back

Pero amigo victoria sÃ³lo quiere amantes 
Puedes perderlo todo si sueÃ±as con ella una vez

Victoria es infiel lo saben hasta los romanos 
Victoria es infiel se lleva mÃ¡s de lo que ha dado 
Victoria es infiel no te confÃ­es en sus brazos 
Victoria es infiel no quiere bodas ni regalos
Es caprichosa lo puedes ver 
Un dÃ­a te da tanto y otro estÃ¡s peor que ayer 
Se rÃ­e de quien cree tener su llave 
Te vuelve codicioso no la quieres perder 
y quiero quedarme quieta mirÃ¡ndote 

No quiero ver a victoria aparecer 
No no no tengo prisa por verla 
y no me arrepiento de ayer 
No quiero vender mi alma a victoria 
Porque victoria es infiel
Victoria es infiel lo saben hasta los romanos 
Victoria es infiel se lleva mÃ¡s de lo que ha dado 
Victoria es infiel no te confÃ­es en sus brazos 
Victoria es infiel no quiere bodas ni regalos",Victoria

Waves upon a tropical shore
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious
Gosh, your lips are delicious
Well, maybe just a cigarette more
Never such a blizzard before

I've got to get home
But, baby, you'll freeze out there
Say, lend me a comb
It's up to your knees out there
You've really been grand
I thrill when you touch my hand
But don't you see
How can you do this thing to me?

There's bound to be talk tomorrow
Think of my life long sorrow
At least there will plenty implied
If you caught pneumonia and died
I really can't stay
Get over that old out, baby
Ahh, but it's cold outside

Where could you be going
When the wind is blowing and it's cold outside?
Baby, it's cold, cold outside",Baby It's Cold Outside
Ella Fitzgerald,"All my life
I've been waiting for you
My wonderful one
I've begun
Living all my life

All my love
Has been waiting for you
My life is sublime
Now that I'm
Giving all my love

You seem so lovely, so far above me
I'm almost afraid to look

Hold me close to your heart
But all else above
Hold my love
Darling, just hold my love",All My Life

With a lonesome feeling and a constant ache
Livin' with my memories just for old time's sake
Crying my heart out for you

Hope you'll be more tender in your next affair
Trust you'll think of me, dear, when you've time to spare
Praying you'll be happy is my only prayer
Crying my heart out for you

Your heart may ache you, friends may forsake you
Sometimes it happens that way
But I'm still for you, always adore you
I love you, I love you; what more can I say?

Searching for a true love, one I couldn't reach

The night is young, the skies are clear
And if you want to go walkin', dear
It's delightful, it's delicious, it's de-lovely

I understand the reason why
You're sentimental, 'cause so am I
It's delightful, it's delicious, it's de-lovely

You can tell at a glance what a swell night this is for romance
You can hear, dear mother nature murmuring low ""let yourself go""

So please be sweet, my chickadee
And when I kiss ya, just say to me
""It's delightful, it's delicious, it's delectable, it's delirious
It's dilemma, it's de limit, it's deluxe, it's de-lovely""

Ella Fitzgerald,"Like the beat, beat, beat of the tom-tom
When the jungle shadows fall
Like the tick, tick, tock of the stately clock
As it stands against the wall

Like the drip, drip, drip of the raindrops
When the summer shower is through
So a voice within me keeps repeating you, you, you

Night and day, you are the one
Only you beneath the moon or under the sun
Whether near to me or far
It's no matter, darling, where you are
I think of you

Night and day, day and night, why is it so
That this longing for you follows wherever I go?
In the roaring traffic's boom
In the silence of my lonely room

I think of you
Night and day, night and day
Under the hide of me
There's an, oh, such a hungry yearning burning inside of me

And its torment won't be through
'Till you let me spend my life making love to you
Day and night, night and day

Night and day
Under the hide of me

Someone, I love
Mad for, my love
So long, Jonah, goodbye
How'm I ridin', I'm ridin' high

Floating, on a starlit ceiling
Doting, on the cards I'm dealing
Gloating, because I'm feeling so hap-hap-happy, I'm slap-happy
So ring bells, sing songs
Blow horns, beat gongs
Our love, never will die
How'm I ridin', I'm ridin' high

Someone, I love
Mad for, my love
So long, Jonah, goodbye

When I'm close to you, dear
The stars fill the sky
So in love with you, am I

Even without you
My arms fold about you
You know, darling, why
So in love with you, am I

In love with the night, mysterious
The night when you first were there
In love with my joy, delirious
When I knew that you could care

So taunt me and hurt me
Deceive me, desert me
I'm yours 'till I die

This funny thing called love?

Won't you turn that new leaf over
So your baby can be your slave?
Oh, why can't you behave?

Where we two can go and try settling down
There, I'll care for you forever
'Cause you're all in the world I crave

Whenever the blues becomes my only song
I concentrate on you

On your smile to sweet so tender
When first my kiss you deny
On the love in your eyes

Ella Fitzgerald,"Love makes me treat you the way that I do
Gee, baby, ain't I good to you
There's nothing too good for a girl, so true
Mama, ain't I good to you

Yes, I bought you furs for Christmas
And a diamond ring
A big Cadillac car and everything
Love makes me treat you the way I do
Gee, baby, ain't I good to you

Love makes me treat you the way that I do
Gee, baby, ain't I good to you
There's nothing too good for a boy, that's so true

Gee baby, ain't I good to you

Love makes me treat you the way that I do
Gee baby, ain't I good to you
There's nothing too good for a boy that's so true
Baby, baby, ain't I good to you

Bought you some crazy sport shirts
You had your fling
A Mercedes Benz sport car and everything

Gee baby, ain't I good to you

Get me paying taxes of what I gave to you
Gee baby, ain't I good to you","Gee Baby, Ain't I Good to You"
Ella Fitzgerald,"Think of what you're losing
By constantly refusing to dance with me
You'd be the idol of France with me
And yet you stand there
And shake your foolish head dramatically
While I wait here so ecstatically
You just look and say emphatically

Not this season, yes that's the reason
I won't dance, don't ask me
I won't dance, don't ask me
I won't dance, madam, with you
My heart won't let my feet
Do things they should do

You know what, you're lovely
And so what, you're still lovely
But oh, what you do to me
I'm like an ocean wave that's bumped on the shore
I feel so absolutely stumped on the floor

Yes, when you dance you're charming and you're gentle
Especially when you do the continental
But this feeling isn't purely mental
For heaven rest us, I'm not asbestos

And that's why
I won't dance, why should I
I won't dance, how could I
I won't dance, merci beaucoup
I know that music leads the way to romance
So if I hold you in my arms, I won't dance

I won't dance, don't ask me
I won't dance, don't ask me
I won't dance, monsieur, with you

You know what, you're kinda lovely

Ella Fitzgerald,"Things have come to a pretty pass
Our romance is growing flat
For you like this and the other
While I go for this and that

Goodness knows what the end will be

It looks as if we two will never be one
Something must be done

You say either and I say either
You say neither and I say neither
Either, either neither, neither

You like potato and I like potahto
You like tomato and I like tomahto
Potato, potahto, tomato, tomahto

But oh, if we call the whole thing off
Then we must part
And oh, if we ever part

I'll wear pyjamas and give up pyajahmas
For we know we need each other so we

You say laughter and I say larfter
You say after and I say arfter

But oh if we call the whole thing off
then we must part
And oh, if we ever part,

Ella Fitzgerald,"Savoy, the home of sweet romance
Savoy, it wins you at a glance
Savoy, gives happy feet a chance to dance
Your old form just like a clinging vine
Your lips so warm and sweet as wine
Your cheek so soft and close to mine, divine

How my heart is singing
While the band is swinging
Never tired of romping
And stomping with you at the Savoy

What joy, a perfect holiday
Savoy, where we can glide and sway
Savoy, let me stomp away with you

Boo ba di ba di di bo bo bo

(Savoy) the home of sweet romance
(Savoy)  wins you at a glance
(Swing it Ella) happy feet
A chance to dance at the Savoy
Like a clinging vine
So warm and sweet as wine
And close to mine, divine

How my heart is singing
While the band is swinging
I'm never tired of romping
And stomping with you at the Savoy

(Savoy) a perfect holiday
Where we can glide and sway
Let me stomp away with you

Da ba da ba di da doo loop

What joy to be together at Savoy
Romping and stomping with you at the Savoy
Never tired of romping
And stomping with you

Ella Fitzgerald,"After one whole quart of brandy
Like a daisy, I'm awake
With no Bromo-Seltzer handy
I don't even shake

Men are not a new sensation
I've done pretty well I think
But this half-pint imitation
Put me on the blink

I'm wild again, beguiled again
A simpering, whimpering child again
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

Couldn't sleep and wouldn't sleep
When love came and told me, I shouldn't sleep
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

Lost my heart, but what of it
He is cold I agree
He can laugh, but I love it
Although the laugh's on me

I'll sing to him, each spring to him
And long, for the day when I'll cling to him
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

He's a fool and don't I know it
But a fool can have his charms
I'm in love and don't I show it
Like a babe in arms

Love's the same old sad sensation
Lately I've not slept a wink
Since this half-pint imitation
Put me on the blink

I've sinned a lot, I'm mean a lot
But I'm like sweet seventeen a lot
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

I'll sing to him, each spring to him
And worship the trousers that cling to him
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

When he talks, he is seeking
Words to get off his chest
Horizontally speaking, he's at his very best

Vexed again, perplexed again
Thank God, I can be oversexed again
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

Wise at last, my eyes at last, 
Are cutting you down to your size at last
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, no more

Burned a lot, but learned a lot
And now","Bewitched, Bothered, And Bewildered"
Ella Fitzgerald,"It's the wrong time and the wrong place
Though your face is charming, it's the wrong face
It's not her face, but such a charming face
That it's all right with me

It's the wrong song in the wrong style
Though your smile is lovely, it's the wrong smile
It's not her smile, but such a lovely smile
So it's all right with me

You can't know how happy I am that we've met
I'm strangely attracted to you
There's someone I'm trying so hard to forget
Don't you want to forget someone too?

It's the wrong game with the wrong chips
Though your lips are tempting, they're the wrong lips
They're not her lips, but they're such tempting lips
That if some night you're free
Dear, it's all right
Yes, it's all right with me",It's Alright With Me

Ella Fitzgerald,"Black cats creep across my path
Until I'm almost mad
I must have 'roused the devil's wrath
'Cause all my luck is bad
I make a date for golf and you can bet your life it rains
I try to give a party and the guy upstairs complains
I guess I'll go through life just catching colds and missin' trains

Everything happens to me
I never miss a thing
I've had the measles and the mumps
And every time I play an ace
My partner always trumps
Guess I'm just a fool who never looks before he jumps

Everything happens to me
At first my heart thought you could break this jinx for me
That love would turn the trick to end despair
But know I just can't fool this head that thinks for me
I've mortgaged all my castles in the air
I've telegraphed and phoned
I send an 'Airmail Special' too

And then it had to be with you

Darling, can't you see?
'Twas for charity?
Though these lips have made slips, it was never really serious
Who'd have thought, I'd be brought to a state that's so delirious?

I could cry salty tears
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now
How long has this been goin' on?

There were chills up my spine
And some thrills I can't define
Listen sweet, I repeat
How long has this been goin' on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt
Into heaven I'm hurled
I know how columbus felt
Finding another world

You have that something, that certain manner

Till wrong is right, till birds refuse to sing
Beyond the years the echo of my only love
Will still be whispering, whispering

If my throbbing heart
Should ever start repeating
That it is tired of beating
Then I'll be tired of you",Then I'll Be Tired of You
Ella Fitzgerald,"Oh, there's a lull in my life 
It's just a void and empty space 
When you are not in my embrace
Oh, there's a lull In my life

Ella Fitzgerald,"I'm trying to explain to friends, dear
The reasons we two are apart
I know what to tell our friends, dear
But what can I tell my heart?

It's easy to say to strangers
That we played the game from the start
It's easy to lie to strangers
But what will I tell my heart?

When I smile to hide all the tears inside
What an ache it will be bring
Then I'll wander home to a telephone
That forgot how to ring, ring, ring

I'm telling you'll soon be back, dear
To fool the whole town may be smart
I'll tell them you'll soon be back, dear
But what will I tell my heart?


I could say that you'll soon be back, dear
To fool the whole town may be smart
I'll tell them you'll soon be back, dear
But what will I tell my heart?",What Will I Tell My Heart?
Ella Fitzgerald,"What's new?
How is the world treating you?
You haven't changed a bit
Handsome as ever I must admit

What's new?
How did that romance come through?
We haven't met since then
Gee, but it's nice to see you again

What's new?
Probably I'm boring you
But seeing you is grand
And you were sweet to offer your hand
I understand

Adieu
Pardon my asking what's new
Of course you couldn't know
I haven't changed
I still love you so

We had to part
The moment you had touched my heart
And with you went my dream

All too soon
All too sweet
Was our affair
And you put all the sweetness there

What a shame that it's gone
All too soon
I knew the strange delights
That only you in love could bring

And as I reached the heights
The bottom fell from everything
You should know as well as I
Our love deserves another try

For we whispered goodbye
All too soon
Too soon",All Too Soon

Ella Fitzgerald,"I was a stranger in the city
Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do?
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning with much alarm
British museum had lost it's charm

How long I wondered
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles hadn't past
For, suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town
The sun was shining everywhere

And other arms may hold a thrill

Heard they crowded the floor

Got as far as the door
They'd have asked me about you
Don't get around much anymore

They're in my baby's smile,

A bicycle built for two,
A memory to get lost in,

Each day was so gay and so daring,
I loved every breathtaking minute,
For how could I know I was sharing
A kiss without a future in it.

You left me a dream to room with,
A coffee pot from Peru,
A knife and fork to spoon with,
Everything but you.

I'd be so lonely
Where am I gonna go if you turn me down

It changes wth the hours

When he's gone I'm cloudy with showers

And motion like the ocean
It's either sink or swim

Like I love him

It was the sweetest melody
I know I lost heaven 'cause you were the song

Am I too late to make amends?

I never wink back at fireflies
But now that the stars are in your eyes
I'm beginning to see the light

I never went in for afterglow
Or candlelight on the mistletoe
But now when you turn the lamp down low
I'm beginning to see the light

Used to ramble through the park
Shadowboxing in the dark
Then you came and caused a spark
That's a four-alarm fire now

I never made love by lantern-shine
I never saw rainbows in my wine
But now that your lips are burning mine
I'm beginning to see the light",I'm Beginning to See the Light

On little blue chairs.

As our blue room far away upstairs!",The Blue Room
Ella Fitzgerald,"The world is lyrical
Because a miracle
Has brought my lover to me
Though he's some other place, his face I see

At night I creep in bed
And never sleep in bed
But look above in the air
And to my greatest joy, my boy is there

It his prince who walks
Into my dreams and talks

He dances overhead
On the ceiling near my bed
In my sight
Through the night

I try to hide in vain
Underneath my counterpane
There's my love
Up above

I whisper, ""Go away, my lover
It's not fair""
But I'm so grateful to discover
He's still there

I love my ceiling more
Since it is a dancing floor
Just for my love

I whisper, ""Go away, my lover
It's not fair""
But I'm so grateful to discover
He's still there

I love my ceiling more
Since it is a dancing floor
Just for my love
Just for my love",Dancing on the Ceiling
Ella Fitzgerald,"The sleepless nights, the daily fights
The quick toboggan, when you reach the heights
I miss the kisses, and I miss the bites
I wish I were in love again

The broken dates, the endless waits
The lovely loving, and the hateful hates
The conversation, with the flying plates
I wish I were in love again

No more pain, no more strain
Now I'm sane, but I would rather be punched, drunk

The pulled out fur, of cat and cur
The fine mismating, of a him and her
I've learned my lesson, but I wish I were
In love again

The furtive sigh, the blackened eye
The words: ""I love you, 'til the day I day""
The self deception, that believes the lie
I wish I were in love again

When love congeals, it soon reveals
The faint aroma, of performing seals
The double-crossing, of a pair of heals
I wish I were in love again

No, no more care, no, no despair
Now I'm all there (now), but I'd rather be punk drunk

Believe me sir, I much prefer
The classic battle, of a him and her
I don't like quiet, and I wish I were
In love again, in love again, in love again",I Wish I Were in Love Again
Ella Fitzgerald,"Mister Shylock was stingy
I was miserly too.
I was more selfish
And crabby than a shellfish.
Oh, dear, it's queer
What love can do!

I'd give all my possessions
For you
I've got five dollars
I'm in good conditions
And I've got ambition
That belongs to you.
Six shirts and collars
Debts beyond endurance
On my life insurance
That belongs to you!

I've got a heart
That must be spurtin'!

Just be certain
I'll be true
Take my five dollars!
Take my shirt and collars!
Take my heart and hollers!
""Ev'rything I've got belongs to you!""

I've got five dollars
Eighty-five relations
Two lace combination's
They belongs to you!
Two coats with collars
Ma and Grandma wore'em
All the moths adore 'em
They belongs to you!

I've got two lips
That care for mating
Therefore waiting
Will not do!
Take my five dollars!
Take my shirt and collars!
Take my heart and hollers!
""Everything I've got belongs to you!""",I've Got Five Dollars
Ella Fitzgerald,"Once I laughed when I heard you saying
That I'd be playing solitaire
Uneasy in my easy chair
It never entered my mind
And once you told me I was mistaken

That I'd awaken with the sun
And ordered orange juice for one
It never entered my mind
You had what I lack, myself

Now I even have to scratch my back myself
Once you warned me that if you scorned me
I'd say a lonely prayer again
And wish that you were there again
To get into my hair again
It never entered my mind

Once you warned me that if you scorned me

To get into my hair again

Ella Fitzgerald,"Johnny could only sing one note
And the note he sings was this
Ah!
Poor Johnny one-note
sang out with ""gusto""
And just overlorded the place
Poor Johnny one-note
yelled willy nilly
Until he was bleu in the face
For holding one note was his ace
Couldn't hear the brass
Couldn't hear the drum
He was in a class
By himself, by gum!

Poor Johnny one-note
Got in Aida
Indeed a great chance to be brave
He took his one note
Howled like the North Wind
Brought forth wind that made critics rave,
While Verdi turned round in his grave!

Couldn't hear the flute
Or the big trombone
Ev'ry one was mute
Johnny stood alone.
Cats and dogs stopped yapping
Lions in the zoo
All were jealous of Johnny's big trill
Thunder claps stopped clapping,
Traffic ceased its roar,
And they tell us Niag'ra stood still.
He stopped the train whistles,
Boat whistles,
steam whistles,
Cop whistles,
all whistles bowed to his skill
Sing Johnny One-Note,
Sing out with ""gusto"" and
Just overwhelm all the crowd
Ah!
So sing Johnny One-Note, out loud!!
Sing Johnny One-Note
Sing Johnny One-Note out loud!",Johnny One Note
Ella Fitzgerald,"When you were very young
The world was younger than you
As merry as a carousel

The circus tent was thrilling
With every star in the sky
Above the rings you loved so well

Now the young world has grown old
Gone is the silver and gold

Sit there, and count your fingers
What can you do?
Old girl you're through
Just sit there, and count your little fingers
Unhappy little girl blue

Sit there, and count the raindrops
Falling on you
It's time you knew
That all you can count on are the raindrops
That fall on little girl blue

No use, old girl
You might as well surrender
Your hopes are getting slender
Why won't somebody send a tender little boy
To cheer up little girl blue?",Little Girl Blue
Ella Fitzgerald,"Lover, when I'm near you, and I hear you, speak my name
Softly, in my ear you, breathe a flame

Lover, when we're dancing, keep on glancing, in my eyes
Till loves own entrancing, music dies

All of my future is in you
Your every plan I design
Promise you'll always continue
To be mine

Lover, please be tender, when you're tender, fears depart
Lover, I surrender, to my heart

Lover, it's immoral, but why quarrel, with our bliss
When, two lips of coral, want to kiss

I say the devil is in you, and to resist you, I try
But if you didn't continue, I would die

Lover, please be tender, when you're tender, fears depart
Lover, I surrender, to my heart",Lover [Stereo Take][Version]
Ella Fitzgerald,"Summer journeys to Niagara and to other places
Aggravate all our cares, we'll save our fares
I've a cozy little flat in what is known as old Manhattan
We'll settle down right here in town

We'll have Manhattan, the Bronx and Staten Island too
It's lovely going through the zoo
It's very fancy on old Delancy Street, you know
The subway charms us so, when balmy breezes blow to and fro

And tell me what street compares with Mott Street in July?
Sweet pushcarts gently gliding by
The great big city's a wondrous toy just made for a girl and boy
We'll turn Manhattan into an isle of joy

We'll go to Yonkers where true love conquers in the whiles
And starve together, dear, in Chiles
We'll go to Coney and eat baloney on a roll
In Central Park we'll stroll, where our first kiss we stole, soul to soul

And ""My Fair Lady"" is a terrific show, they say
We both may see it close some day
The city's glamor can never spoil the dreams of a boy and goil
We'll turn Manhattan into an isle of joy",Manhattan
Ella Fitzgerald,"Spring is here! Why doesn't my heart go dancing?
Spring is here! Why isn't the waltz entrancing?
No desire, no ambition leads me
Maybe it's because nobody needs me
Spring is here! Why doesn't the breeze delight me?
Stars appear, why doesn't the night invite me?
Maybe it's because nobody loves me
Spring is here I hear
 
Spring is here! Why doesn't my heart go dancing?
Spring is here! Why isn't the waltz entrancing?

Ella Fitzgerald,"I've been married, and married, and often I've sighed
""I'm never a bridesmaid, I'm always a bride""

I never divorced them, I hadn't the heart
Yet remember these sweet words, ""'till death do us part""

I married many men, a ton of them
Because I was untrue to none of them
Because I bumped off every one of them
To keep my love alive

Sir Paul was frail, he looked a wreck to me
At night he was a horse's neck to me
So I performed an appendectomy
To keep my love alive

Sir Thomas had insomnia, he couldn't sleep at night
I bought a little arsenic, he's sleeping now all right

Sir Philip played the harp, I cussed the thing
I crowned him with his harp to bust the thing
And now he plays where harps are just the thing
To keep my love alive
To keep my love alive

(bridge)
I thought Sir George had possibilities
But his flirtations made me ill at ease
And when I'm ill at ease, I kill at ease
To keep my love alive

Sir Charles came from a sanatorium
And yelled for drinks in my emporium
I mixed one drink, he's in memorium
To keep my love alive

Sir Francis was a singing bird, a nightingale, that's why
I tossed him off my balcony, to see if he, could fly

Sir Atherton indulged in fratricide,
He killed his dad and that was patricide
One night I stabbed him by my mattress-side
To keep my love alive
To keep my love alive
To keep my love alive",To Keep My Love Alive
Ella Fitzgerald,"It seems we stood and talked like this, before
We looked at each other in the same way then
But I can't remember where or when

The clothes you're wearing are the clothes, you wore
The smile you are smiling you were smiling then
But I can't remember where or when

Some things that happened for the first time
Seem to be happenin' again
And so it seems that we have met before
And laughed before, and loved before
But who knows where or when

Some things that happened for the first time
Seem to be happenin' again
And so it seems that we have met before
And laughed before, and loved before
But who knows where or when

When you're awake, the things you think
Come from the dream you dream
Thought has wings, and lots of things
Are seldom what they seem
Sometimes you think you've lived before
All that you live to day
Things you do come back to you
As though they knew the way
Oh the tricks your mind can play",Where or When
Ella Fitzgerald,"Though I know that we meet every night
And we couldn't have change since the last time,
To my joy and delight,
It's a new kind of love at first sight.
Though it's you and it's I all the time
Every meeting's marvelous pastime.
You're increasingly sweet,
So whenever we happened to met
I greet you 

With a song in my heart
I behold your adorable face.
Just a song at the start
But it soon is a hymn to your grace.
When the music swells
I'm touching you hand
It tells that you're standing near, and 

At the sound of your voice
Heaven opens his portals to me.
Can I help but rejoice
That a song such as ours came to be?
But I always knew
I would live life through
With a song in my heart for you.

Oh, the moon's not a moon for a night
And these stars will not twinkle and fade out,
And the words in my ears
Will resound for the rest of my years.
In the morning I find with delight
Not a note of our music is played out.
It will be just as sweet,
And an air that I'll live to repeat:
I greet you 

With a song in my heart
I behold your adorable face.
Just a song at the start
But it soon is a hymn to your grace.
When the music swells
I'm touching you hand
It tells that you're standing near, and

Ella Fitzgerald,"Don't stamp your foot at me
It's impolite
To stamp your foot at me
Is not quite right
At man's ingratitude
A woman winks
But such an attitude just stinks

I have eyes for you to give you dirty looks
I have words that do not come from children's books
there's a trick with a knife I'm learning to do
And everything I've got belongs to you
I've a powerful anesthesia in my fist
And the perfect wrist to give your neck a twist
There are hammerlock holds
I've mastered a few
And everything I've got belongs to you
Share for share, share alike
You get struck each time I strike
You for me- me for me
I'll give you plenty of nothing
I'm not yours for better but for worse
And I've learned to give the well-known witches' curse
I've a terrible tongue, a temper for two
And ev'rything I've got belongs to you

Don't raise your voice at me
That's very rude
To raise your voice at me
Is rather crude
It's wrong essentially when woman yells
And confidentially, it smells

I'll converse with you on politics at length
I'll protect you with my superhuman strength
If you're ever attacked I'll scream and say , ""Boo!''
And everything I've got belongs to you
I will never stray from home, I'll just stay put
Cause I've got a brand-new thing called athlete' s foot
I'm a victim of colds, anemia, too
And everything I've got belongs to you
Off to bed we will creep
Then we'll sleep and sleep and sleep
Till the birds start to peep
I'll give you plenty of nothing
I'll be yours forever and a day
If the first good breeze does not blow me away
You're enough for one man, that's why I'll be true
And everything I've got belongs to you

You may have some things that I can't use at all
When I look at you, your manly gifts are small
I've a wonderful way of saying adieu
And everything I've got belongs to you
You won't know how good I am until you try
And you'll let my well of loneliness run dry
I've a marvelous way of telling you no
And everything I've got belongs to you
And everything you want belongs to me!
And everything you need belongs to me!

Life has no shape or form
And no design
It isn't life without
That fool of mine
I used to gad about
With any chap
And now I'm sad about my sap

He's a living thing that isn't quite alive
He has brains enough for any child of five
Oh, he isn't too rich in vigor and vim
But everything I've got belongs to him
He's a naughty brat that can't be left alone
He has eyes for every skirt except my own
Even under a tree, he grabs for the limb
But everything I've got belongs to him
Something beats in his chest
But it's just a pump at best
I'm for him, he's for him
He gives me plenty of nothing
When I see that funny face, I know
Something scared his mother twenty years ago
But I'll never let go, he'll never be free!
Till everything he's got belongs to me!

And everything I've got belongs to him!
And everything I've got belongs to us!",Ev'rything I've Got

Grand to be alive, to be young,
To be mad, to be yours alone!
Grand to see your face, feel your touch,

Hear your voice say I'm all your own.

Ten cents a dance, that's what they pay me
Gosh how they weigh me down.

It turned out to be the luckiest day i've known

Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British museum, had lost its charm

Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past

Ella Fitzgerald,"It's the wrong time, and the wrong place
Though your face is charming, it's the wrong face
It's not her face, but such a charming face
That it's all right with me

It's the wrong song, in the wrong style
Though your smile is lovely, it's the wrong smile
It's not her smile, but such a lovely smile
That it's all right with me

You can't know how happy i am that we met
I'm strangely attracted to you
There's someone I'm trying so hard to forget
Don't you want to forget someone, too?

It's the wrong game, with the wrong chips
Though your lips are tempting, they're the wrong lips
They're not her lips, but they're such tempting lips
That, if some night, you are free
Then it's all right, yes, it's all right with me",It's All Right with Me [#]
Ella Fitzgerald,"As dorothy parker once said
To her boyfriend, ""fare thee well""
As columbus announced
When he knew he was bounced,
""it was swell, isabel, swell""

As abelard said to eloise,
""don't forget to drop a line to me, please""
As juliet cried, in her romeo's ear,
""romeo, why not face the fact, my dear""

It was just one of those things
Just one of those crazy flings

Just one of those things

If we'd thought a bit, of the end of it
When we started painting the town
We'd have been aware that our love affair
Was too hot, not to cool down

So good-bye, dear, and amen
Here's hoping we meet now and then

Ella Fitzgerald,"I've wined and dined on Mulligan Stew, and never wished for Turkey
As I hitched and hiked and grifted too, from Maine to Albuquerque
Alas, I missed the Beaux Arts Ball, and what is twice as sad
I was never at a party where they honored Noel Ca-ad (Coward)
But social circles spin too fast for me
My ""hobohemia"" is the place to be

I get too hungry, for dinner at eight
I like the theater, but never come late
I never bother, with people I hate
That's why the lady is a tramp

I don't like crap games, with barons and earls
Won't go to Harlem, in ermine and pearls
Won't dish the dirt, with the rest of the girls
That's why the lady is a tramp

I like the free, fresh wind in her hair
Life without care
I'm broke, it's OK
Hate California, it's cold and it's damp
That's why the lady is a tramp

I go to Coney, the beach is divine
I go to ballgames, the bleachers are fine
I follow Winchell, and read every line
That's why the lady is a tramp

I like a prizefight, that isn't a fake
I love the rowing, on Central Park lake
I go to Opera and stay wide awake
That's why the lady is a tramp

I like the green grass under my shoes
What can I lose, I'm flat, that's that
I'm alone when I lower my lamp
That's why the lady is a tramp",The Lady Is a Tramp [#][*]
Ella Fitzgerald,"Your lips were like a red and ruby chalice, warmer than the summer night
The clouds were like an alabaster palace rising to a snowy height.
Each star it's own aurora borealis, suddenly you held me tight,
I could see the midnight sun.

I can't explain the silver rain that found me--or was that a moonlight veil?
The music of the universe around me, or was that a nightingale?
And then your arms miraculously found me,suddenly the sky turned pale,
I could see the midnight sun.

Was there such a night, it's a thrill i still don't quite believe,
But after you were gone, there was still some stardust on my sleeve.

The flame of it may dwindle to an ember, and the stars forget to shine,
And we may see the meadow in december, icy white and crystalline.
But oh my darling always i'll remember when your lips were close to mine,
And we saw the midnight sun.",Midnight Sun [#]
Ella Fitzgerald,"Savoy, the home of sweet romance,
Savoy, it wins you with a glance,
Savoy, gives happy feet a chance to dance.
Your old form just like a clinging vine,
Your lips so warm and sweet as wine,
Your cheek so soft and close to mine, divine.

How my heart is singing,
While the band is swinging,
I'm never tired of romping,
And stomping with you at the Savoy.

What joy, a perfect holiday,
Savoy, where we can glide and sway,
Savoy, let me stomp away with you
The home of sweet romance,
It wins you at a glance,
Gives happy feet a chance to dance.

Just like a clinging vine,
So soft and sweet as wine,
So soft and close to mine, divine.

Ella Fitzgerald,"Oh! Will you never let me be?
Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things [#]
Ella Fitzgerald,"I saw a blind man,
He was a kind man,
Helping a fellow along,
One could not see,
One could not walk,
But they both were humming this song;
 
When you're smiling, When you're smiling, 
The whole world smiles with you,
When you're laughing, When you're laughing,
The sun comes shining through,
But when you're crying you bring on the rain,
So stop your sighing be happy again,
Keep on smiling 'cause when you're smiling,
The whole world smiles with you.
 
I used to worry,
I used to hurry,
Each time it started to rain,
Now I see light,
Learned wrong from right,
And you'll never hear me complain;

The whole world smiles with you,

Ella Fitzgerald,"Once there was a kiss,
A kiss made of gold,
Made of lover's gold
Because the kiss was true.

Once there was a fool
Who shared this lover's gold,
But, just like a fool,
Its worth she never knew!

Now she walks alone and broken hearted,
For you've heard it told,
A fool and his gold
Are soon parted!

Saddest thing of all,
About the tale I've told,
Is that I'm the fool
Who wasted lover's gold!

I'll tell you no lie
How deep is the ocean? 
How high is the sky? 

How many times a day do I think of you? 
How many roses are sprinkled with dew? 

How far would I travel
To be where you are? 
How far is the journey
From here to a star? 

And if I ever lost you
How much would I cry? 
How deep is the ocean? 
How high is the sky?",How Deep Is the Ocean?
Ella Fitzgerald,"Strange
How a dreary world can suddenly change
To a world as bright as the evening star
Queer
What a difference when your vision is clear
And you see things as they really are

I used to be color-blind
But I met you and now I find
There's green in the grass
There's gold in the moon
There's blue in the skies

That semi-circle that was always hanging about
Is not a storm cloud, it's a rainbow
And you brought the colors out

Believe me it's really true
Till I met you I never knew
A setting sun could paint such beautiful skies

I never knew there were such lovely colors
And the big surprise
Is the red in your cheeks
The gold in your hair
The blue in your eyes",I Used to Be Color Blind
Ella Fitzgerald,"Every time
I see a puppy upon a summer's day
A puppy dog at play
My heart is filled with envy
That's because
My heart is yearning to pass the time away
Like that pup
'cause I'm all fed up
And tho' it's wrong to be
I long to be

[Chorus:]
Lazy
I want to be lazy
I want to be out in the sun
With no work to be done

Under that awning
They call the sky
Stretching and yawning
And let the world go drifting by

I want to peep
Through the deep
Tangled wildwood
Counting sheep
'til I sleep
Like a child would

With a great big valise full
Of books to read where it's peaceful
While I'm
Killing time
Being lazy

Life is short
And getting shorter with each day that goes by
And how the time does fly
Before you know, it's over
That's why I'm
In such a hurry to pack my things and fly
To a spot
Where it's nice and hot
And hear the birdies sing
While I'm being",Lazy
Ella Fitzgerald,"As you listen to the band don't you get a bubble? 
As you listen to them play don't you get a glow? 
If you step out on the floor
You'll forget your trouble
If you go into your dance
You'll forget your woe
So

Come
Get together
Let the dance floor feel your leather
Step as lightly as a feather
Let yourself go

Come
Hit the timber
Loosen up and start to limber
Can't you hear that hot marimba? 
Let yourself go

Let yourself go
Relax
And let yourself go
Relax
You've got yourself tied up in a knot
The night is cold but the music's hot
So

Come
Cuddle closer

Ella Fitzgerald,"There may be trouble ahead
But while there's music and moonlight (moonlight and music) and love and romance
Let's face the music and dance

Before the fiddlers have fled
Before they ask us to pay the bill, and while we still have that chance
Let's face the music and dance

Soon, we'll be without the moon
Humming a different tune, and then

There may be teardrops to shed

Ella Fitzgerald,"One little kiss, a moment of bliss, then hours of deep regret
One little smile, and after a while, a longing to forget
One little heartache left as a token
One little plaything carelessly broken

Remember the night
The night you said, ""I love you""
Remember?

Remember you vowed
By all the stars above you
Remember?

Remember we found a lonely spot
And after I learned to care a lot

You promised that you'd forget me not
But you forgot
To remember

Into my dreams you wandered it seems, and then there came a day
You loved me too, my dreams had come true, and all the world was
May
But soon the may time turned to December
You had forgotten, do you remember?",Remember
Ella Fitzgerald,"Where the dreamy Volga flows
There's a lonely Russian rose
Gazing tenderly
Down upon her knee
Where a baby's brown eyes glisten
Listen

Every night you'll hear her croon
A Russian lullaby

Just a little plaintive tune
When baby starts to cry

Rock-a-bye my baby
Somewhere there may be

A land that's free for you and me
And a Russian lullaby",Russian Lullaby

I'm steppin' out, my dear
To breathe an atmosphere that simply reeks with class
And I trust that you'll excuse my dust when I step on the gas

For I'll be there
Puttin' down my top hat
Mussin' up my white tie
Dancin' in my tails

I just got an invitation through the mails

Ella Fitzgerald,"You can have him
I don't want him
He's not worth fighting for
Besides there's plenty more where he came from
I don't want him
You can have him
I'm giving him the sack
And he can go right back where he came from
I could never make him happy
He'd be better off with you
I'm afraid I never loved him
All I ever wanted to do was

Run my fingers through his curly locks
Mend his underwear and darn his socks
Fetch his slippers and remove his shoes
Wipe his glasses when he read the news
Rub his forehead with a gentle touch
Mornings after when he's had too much
Kiss him gently when he cuddled near
Give him babies one for ev'ry year, so you see
I don't want him, you can have him
You can have him, I don't want him
For he's not the man for me

You can have him
I don't want him
He's not worth fighting for
Besides there's plenty more where he came from
I don't want him
You can have him
He isn't my concern
And he can just return where he came from
I would look a trifle silly
Taking him away from you
That was never my intention
All I ever wanted to do was

Close the window while he soundly slept
Raid the icebox where the food is kept
Cook a breakfast that would please him most
Eggs and coffee and some buttered toast
Wake him gently with a breakfast tray
After breakfast clear the things away
Bring the papers and when they've been read
Spend the balance of the day in bed, so you see
I don't want him, you can have him
You can have him, I don't want him
For he's not the man for me",You Can Have Him
Ella Fitzgerald,"Love you which is easy to see
But I have to keep guessing how you feel about me
You listen to the words that I speak
But I feel that you listen with your tongue in your cheek

You're laughing at me
I can't get sentimental
For you're laughing at me I know

I want to be romantic but I haven't a chance
You've got a sense of humor, and humor is death to romance

You're laughing at me
Why do you think it's funny

Ella Fitzgerald,"Must you dance every dance with the same fortunate man? 
You have danced with him since the music began.
Won't you change partners and dance with me? 
Must you dance quite so close with your lips touching his face? 
Can't you see
I'm longing to be in his place? 
Won't you change partners and dance with me? 

Ask him to sit this one out.
While you're alone,

You may never want to change partners again.",Change Partners

I know where to find the boys
I don't go through a club or two

I find you then with other men
And wonder when my chance will arrive

How's chances, say, how are the chances
Of making you love me the way I love you

How many young men must I fight with
To be in right with
In right with you

How's chances for one of those glances
A glimpse of the heaven I'm longing to see

How's chances to end all your romances
And start taking your chances with me

Ceiling and flooring
Furniture, too",How's Chances?

Like a sailor that goes to sea
Like an unwritten melody

What a very special time for me

In the room and I
As I recall it ended much too soon

Oh, what a night
Hypnotizing, mesmerizing me
She was everything I dreamed she'd be
Sweet surrender, what a night

I felt a rush like a rolling bolt of thunder
Spinnin' my head around and taking my body under

Oh, I, I got a funny feeling when she walked
In the room and I
As I recall it ended much too soon

Ella Fitzgerald,"Every time it rains
I think of you
And that's the time
I feel so blue
The rain starts to fall
Across my window's pane
But it's raining teardrops
From my eyes

If you see tears
Here in my eyes
It's just because
You said goodbye
So, baby, won't you hurry?
Because I love you so
And it's raining teardrops
From my eyes

Remember the night you told me
Our love would always be
I wouldn't be sad and lonely
If you were here with me

Every single cloud
Would disappear
I'd wear a smile
If you were here
So, baby, won't you hurry?
Because I love you so
And it's raining teardrops
From my eyes",Teardrops from My Eyes
Ella Fitzgerald,"What's your story, morning glory?
What makes you look so blue?
The way that you've been acting
I don't know what to do
For I love you, sure as one and one make two
What's your story, morning glory?
Got a feeling there's a lot you're concealing
So, won't you let me know your point of view?

What is your story, morning glory?
You've got me worried too
The postman came this morning
And left a note for you
Did you read it? Then you know that I love you
What's your story, morning glory?
Give your answer to this patient romancer
Oh, won't you tell me that you love me too?","What's Your Story, Morning Glory?"
Ella Fitzgerald,"If the nightingales could sing like you
They'd sing much sweeter than they do
For you brought a new kind of love to me

And if the sandman brought me dreams of you
I'd want to sleep my whole life through
You brought a new love to me

I know that I'm the slave, you're the queen
Still, you can understand that underneath it all
You're a man and I am only a maid

I have to call
'Cause you have so much on the ball

Matter-of-factly don't know exactly what it is that you've got

Ella Fitzgerald,"In a little honky-tonky village in Texas
There's a guy who plays the best piano by far
He can play piano any way that you like it
But the way he likes to play is eight to the bar
When he plays, it's a ball
He's the daddy of them all

The people gather around when he gets on the stand
Then when he plays, he gets a hand
The rhythm he beats puts the cats in a trance
Nobody there bothers to dance
But when he plays with the bass and guitar
They holler out, ""Beat me Daddy, eight to the bar""

A-plink, a-plank, a-plink plank, plink plank
A-plunkin' on the keys
A-riff, a-raff, a-riff raff, riff raff
A-riffin' out with ease
And when he plays with the bass and guitar
They holler out, ""Beat me Daddy, eight to the bar""

He plays a boogie, he plays eight to the bar
A boogie-woogie, that is the way he likes to play on his piano
And we all know
That when he plays he puts them all in a trance

You'll hear them say, ""Beat me Daddy, eight to the bar""

He goes where all the angry young men go
Recites poetry, like young

And we're homin' it, like now
We spin records on cloud number seven

I'm such a happy individual

The moment that you speak

I want to go and bounce the moon
Just like a toy balloon

You and I are just like a couple of tots
Running across the meadow
Picking up lots of forget-me-nots

You make me feel so young
You make me feel there are songs to be sung
Bells to be rung
And a wonderful fling to be flung

Ella Fitzgerald,"I fetch his slippers, fill up the pipe he smokes
I cook the kippers, laugh at his oldest jokes
Yet here I anchor, I might have had a banker
Boy! what love has done to me
His nature's funny, quarrelsome half the time
And as for money, he hasn't got a dime
And here's the joker, I might have had a broker
Boy! what love has done to me
When a guy looks my way
Does he get emphatic, say he gets dramatic?
I just want to fly 'way
But if I left him I'd be all at sea
I'm just a slavey, life is a funny thing
He's got the gravy, I got a wedding ring
And still I love him, there's nobody above him
Boy! what love has done to me
His brains are minus,
Never a thought in sight

And yet his highness
Lectures me day and night;
Oh where was my sense
To sign that wedding license?
Boy! What love has done to me!
My life he's wrecking, bet you could find him now
Out somewhere necking somebody else's frau
You get to know life when married to a low life
Boy! what love has done to me
I can't hold my head up
The butcher, the baker, oh no he's a faker
Brother I am fed up
But if I left him he'd be up a tree
Where will it wind up, I don't know where I'm at
I make my mind up, I oughta leave him flat
But I have grown so, I love that dirty so-and-so
Boy! what love has done to me.",Boy What Love Has Done To Me
Ella Fitzgerald,"Near Barcelona, the peasant crooned
The old traditional Spanish tunes
The Neapolitan street song sighs
You think of Italian skies

Each nation has a creative vein
Originating a native strain
With folk songs plaintive and others gay
In their own peculiar way

American folk songs, i feel
Have a much stronger appeal

The real American folksong is a rag
A mental jag
A rhythmic tonic for the chronic blues

The critics called it a ""joke song"" but now
They've changed their tune, and they like it, somehow

For it's inoculated with a syncopated sort of meter, sweeter
Than a classic strain, boy you can't remain, still or quiet, for it's a riot

The real American folksong
Is like a fountain of youth
You taste, and it elates you, and then, invigorates you
The real American folksong, the masses coaxed on, is a rag

Ella Fitzgerald,"Once I visited my cousin, in Milwaukee, USA
She got boyfriends by the dozen, when she sang in a lowdown way
She was a positive sensation
The songs that she sang would never miss
My cousin was my inspiration
That`s how I got like this

I got a cousin in Milwaukee
She`s got a voice so squawky
And though she`s tall and kind of gawky
Oh, how she gets the men

Her singing isn`t operatic
It`s got a lot of static
What makes your heart get acrobatic
Nine times out of ten

When she sings hot, you can`t be solemn
It sends the shivers up and down your spinal column
When she sings blue, the men shout, ""What stuff!""
That baby is hot stuff

So if you like the way I sing songs,
If you think that I`m a wow
You can thank my squawky cousin from Milwaukee
Because she taught me how

You`re my silver lining,

Soon, you'll find I live for you only.

Home through every storm, never failing,
The day you're mine this world will be in tune,

No use concealing

Are turning into thin air
And it seems that suddenly I've
Become the happiest girl alive

Things are looking up
I've been looking the landscape over
And it`s covered with four leaf clover
Oh things are looking up
Since love looked up at me

Bitter was my cup
But no more will I be the mourner
For I've certainly turned the corner

Who cares what the public chatters
Love's the only thing that matters

Who cares if the sky cares to fall in the sea
Who cares what banks fail in Yonkers
Long as you've got a kiss that conquers?

Why should I care?
Life is one long jubilee,
So long as I care for you
And you care for me!

Who cares how history rates me
As long as your kiss intoxicates me?

Like a daisy, I'm awake
With no bromo-seltzer handy
I don't even shake

Men are not a new sensation
I've done pretty well I think
But this half-pint imitation
Put me on the blink

I'm wild again, beguiled again
A simpering, whimpering child again
Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered am I

Couldn't sleep and wouldn't sleep
When love came and told me I shouldn't sleep
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered am I

Lost my heart, but what of it
He is cold I agree
He can laugh, but I love it
Although the laugh's on me

I'll sing to him, each spring to him
And long for the day when I'll cling to him
Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered am I

He's a fool and don't I know it
But a fool can have his charms
I'm in love and don't I show it
Like a babe in arms

Love's the same old sad sensation
Lately I've not slept a wink
Since this half-pint imitation
Put me on the blink

I've sinned a lot; I'm mean a lot
But I'm like sweet seventeen a lot
Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered am I

I'll sing to him, each spring to him
And worship the trousers that cling to him
Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered am I

When he talks, he is seeking
Words to get off his chest
Horizontally speaking, he's at his very best

Vexed again, perplexed again
Thank God, I can be oversexed again
Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered am I

Wise at last, my eyes at last
Are cutting you down to your size at last
Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered no more

Burned a lot, but learned a lot
And now you are broke, so you earned a lot
Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered no more

Couldn't eat, was dyspeptic
Life was so hard to bear
Now my heart's antiseptic

Down to the village

With a broomstick in his hand
Running here and there all around the square
Saying catch me if you can
He led them down the streets of town

Right to the traffic cop

He heard him holler stop

Was seated by my side;

Misfortune seemed his lot,
We ran into a drifted bank
And there we got upsot.

The story I must tell
I went out on the snow
And on my back I fell;
A gent was riding by
In a one-horse open sleigh

I there sprawling laid
But quickly drove away.

Now that Macky's back in town

Look out to Miss Lotte Lenya and old Lucy Brown
Yes, that line forms on the right, babe
Now that Macky's back in town
Look out, old Macky's back!!",Mack the Knife
Ella Fitzgerald,"That old black magic has me in its spell
That old black magic that you weave so well
Icy fingers up and down my spine
The same old witchcraft when your eyes meet mine

The same old tingle that I feel inside
When that elevator starts its ride
Down and down I go, 'round and 'round I go
Like a leaf that's caught in the tide

I should stay away, but what can I do?
I hear your name, and I'm aflame
Aflame with such a burning desire
That only your kiss can put out the fire

You are the lover that I've waited for
The mate that fate had me created for
And every time your lips meet mine
Baby, down and down I go
All around I go, in a spin
Loving the spin that I'm in
Under that old black magic called love",That Old Black Magic
Ella Fitzgerald,"As Dorothy Parker once said
To her boyfriend, ""fare thee well""
As Columbus announced
When he knew he was bounced,
""it was swell, Isabel, swell""

As Abelard said to Eloise,
""don't forget to drop a line to me, please""
As Juliet cried, in her romeo's ear,
""romeo, why not face the fact, my dear""

It was just one of those things
Just one of those crazy flings
One of those bells that now and then rings
Just one of those things

It was just one of those nights
Just one of those fabulous flights
A trip to the moon on gossamer wings
Just one of those things

If we'd thought a bit, of the end of it
When we started painting the town
We'd have been aware that our love affair
Was too hot, not to cool down

So good-bye, dear, and amen
Here's hoping we meet now and then
It was great fun
But it was just one of those things

Ella Fitzgerald,"When the only sound in the empty street
Is the heavy tread of the heavy feet

Ella Fitzgerald,"I remember other days how I used to weep 
Over things you said to me; I couldn't even sleep
You forgot your promises, every single vow
All you did was laugh at me, but things are different now
 
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
Every road has a turning
That's one thing you're learning
I cried for you; what a fool I used to be
Now I found two eyes just a little bit bluer
I found a heart just a little bit truer
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
 
How can I forget the hours that I worried through
Wondering the live long day just what next thing to do?
In those days you never thought anything of me
But the slave that was all yours and now at last is free
 
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
Every road has a turning
That's one thing you're learning
I cried for you; what a fool I used to be
Now I found two eyes just a little bit bluer
I found a heart just a little bit truer
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me",I Cried for You
Ella Fitzgerald,"I hadn't anyone till you, I was a lonely one till you
I used to lie awake and wonder, if there could be
A someone in this wide world, just made for me
And now I see I had to save my love for you

I never gave my love till you
And through my lonely heart demanding it, 
Cupid took a hand in it
I hadn't anyone till you
And through my lonely heart demanding it, 
Cupid took a hand in it
I hadn't anyone till you",I Hadn't Anyone Till You
Ella Fitzgerald,"Never thought I'd fall,
But now I hear love call,
I'm getting sentimental over you

Things you say and do,
Just thrill me through and through,
I'm getting sentimental over you.

I thought I was happy,
I could live without love
Now I must admit,
Love is all I'm thinking of

Won't you please be kind,
And just make up your mind
That you'll be sweet & gentle,
Be gentle with me
Because I'm sentimental over you",I'm Getting Sentimental over You
Ella Fitzgerald,"Come to me, my melancholy baby
Cuddle up and don't be blue
All your fears are foolish fancy, maybe
You know, dear, that I'm in love with you

Every cloud must have a silver lining
Wait until the sun shines through

Cuddle up, my dear
While, I kiss away each tear
Or else, I shall be melancholy too

Every cloud must have a silver lining
Wait until the sun shines through

Please, cuddle up, my dear
While, I kiss away each tear
Or else, I shall be melancholy too",My Melancholy Baby
Ella Fitzgerald,"Reach for tomorrow
Today belongs to the past
The golden hopes of your yesterdays
Can all be yours at last

Reach for tomorrow
And keep your head in the sky
You may get hurt
In a thousand ways
But give it one more try

Have no regret about
Forget about
The chances you missed
In days to come
I know there's something
Better than this

Reach for tomorrow
And keep your dreams ever new
No matter how many times it seems
That dreams are not for you

Reach for tomorrow
And make them all come true",Reach for Tomorrow
Ella Fitzgerald,"When I was a young man courting the girls
I played me a waiting game
If a maid refused me with tossing curls
I'd let the old Earth make a couple of whirls
While I plied her with tears in lieu of pearls
And as time came around she came my way
As time came around, she came

When you meet with the young girls early in the spring
You court them in song and rhyme
They answer with words and a clover ring
But if you could examine the goods they bring
They have little to offer but the songs they sing
And the plentiful waste of time of day
A plentiful waste of time

Oh, it's a long, long while from May to December
But the days grow short when you reach September
When the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame
One hasn't got time for the waiting game

Oh, the days dwindle down to a precious few
September, November
And these few precious days I'll spend with you
These precious days I'll spend with you",September Song
Ella Fitzgerald,"If you've never had to count a million sheep
Then you've never been blue, never been blue
If you've never had to cry yourself to sleep
Then you've never been blue, never been blue

I know I could go on laughing and troubled
Plain trouble
But when it concerns the heart
The pain seems doubled

Never worry about a little hurt or two
There's nothing at all bothering you
If you've never had a pal who stole your gal
Then you've never known you've never been blue

Something that this life will mind is plain, honey
That's funny
When you're miles away from home
It's not so sunny

No one ever knows what I go through
While someone at home is babying you
If you've never had to miss a goodnight kiss
Then you've never known you've never been blue",Then You've Never Been Blue
Ella Fitzgerald,"Who's Sorry Now?
Who's Sorry Now?
Who's heart is aching for breaking each vow?
Who's sad and blue?
Who's crying too? 
Just like I cried over you.
Right to the end, 
Just like a friend,
I tried to warn you somehow.
You had your way,
Now you must pay;",Who's Sorry Now?
Ella Fitzgerald,"It begins to tell 'round midnight, midnight
I do pretty well till after sundown
Supper time I'm feelin' sad
But it really gets bad 'round midnight

Memories always start 'round midnight
Haven't got the heart to stand those memories
When my heart is still with you
And ol' midnight knows it too

When a quarrel we had needs mending
Does it mean that our love is ending?
Darlin', I need you; lately I find
You're out of my heart and I'm out of my mind

Let our hearts take wings 'round midnight, midnight
Let the angels sing for your returning
Till our love is safe and sound
And old midnight comes around

Feelin' sad really gets bad
'Round, 'round, 'round midnight",'Round Midnight
Ella Fitzgerald,"Night and stars above that shine so bright 
The mystery of their fading light 
That shines upon our caravan 
 
Sleep upon my shoulder as we creep 
Across the sand so I may keep 
The memory of our caravan 
 
This is so exciting 
You are so inviting 
Resting in my arms 
As I thrill to the magic charms 
Of you beside me here beneath the blue 
My dream of love is coming true 
Within our desert caravan",Caravan
Ella Fitzgerald,"I don't believe in frettin' and grievin'
Why mess around with strife?
I never was cut out to step and strut out
Give me the simple life

Some find it pleasant dining on pheasant
Those things roll off my knife
Just serve me tomatoes and mashed potatoes
Give me the simple life

A cottage small is all I'm after
Not one that's spacious and wide
A home that rings with joy and laughter
And the ones you love inside

Some like the high road, I like the low road
Free from the grief and strife
Sounds corny and seedy, but, yes, indeedy
Give me the simple life",Give Me the Simple Life
Ella Fitzgerald,"I heard it came to town
A new kind of rhythm
Spread around

I'm as jumpy as a puppet on a string
I'd say that I had Spring fever
But I know it isn't Spring

I am starry-eyed and vaguely discontented
Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even Spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing

But moonbeams being gold are something I can't behold

When you left the curtain fell
I'd like to laugh but nothing strikes me funny

And that alone is more than I was created for

Ella Fitzgerald,"The moon is the same moon above you
Aglow with it's cool evening light
But shining at night, in Tunisia
Never does it shine so bright

The stars are aglow in the heavens
But only the wise understand
That shining at night in Tunisia
They guide you through the desert sand

Words fail, to tell a tale
Too exotic to be told
Each night's a deeper night
In a world, ages old

The cares of the day seem to vanish
The ending of day brings release
Each wonderful night in Tunisia
Where the nights are filled with peace

Each wonderful night in Tunisia",A Night in Tunisia
Ella Fitzgerald,"When days are long and nights are lonely
And all my daydreams have gone astray
I think about the one and only
Who's bound to find me some golden day

The one I love is coming along some day
And I'll have none except the one I love
He/She may be near or ever so far away
But I'll have none except the one I love

And though our meeting is left to chance
Until our meeting 
I still will have my dream romance
And through the night I pray to the moon above
To please be kind and find the one I love",The One I Love (Belongs to Somebody Else) [#][*]

Does it surprise you
I won't need your lips anymore

Now that I've told you
That this is just where I came in

Signing off
Why should I hold you

The things you should see at a glance
And I want what all of the world knows

Ella Fitzgerald,"The song a robin sings,
Through years of endless springs,
The murmur of a brook at evening tides.
That ripples through a nook where two lovers hide.

That great symphonic theme,
That's Stella by starlight,
And not a dream,
My heart and I agree,
She's everything on this earth to me.

Ella Fitzgerald,"You're walkin' along the street, or you're at a party,
Or else you're alone and then you suddenly dig,
You're looking' in someone's eyes, you suddenly realize
That this could be the start of something big.

You're lunching at twenty-one and watchin' your diet,
Declining a Charlotte russe, accepting a fig,
When out of a clear blue sky, it's suddenly gal and guy,
And this could be the start of something big.

There's no controlling the unrolling of your fate, my friend,
Who knows what's written in the magic book.
But when a lover you discover at the gate my friend,
Invite her in without a second look.

You're up in an aeroplane or dining at sardi's,
Or lying at Malibu alone on the sand,
You suddenly hear a bell, and right away you can tell
That this could be the start of something grand.

This could be the start of something very big,
Why don't you play your part?
Please give your heart to me, and see.
This could be the start of something wonderful,
Why don't you take a chance?
Just try romance with me, and see.

Your watchin' the sun come up and countin' your money,
Or else in a dim cafe you're ordering wine,
Then suddenly there he is, and you wanna be where he is,
And this must be the start of something,
This could be the heart of something,
This could be the start of something big.",This Could Be the Start of Something Big [#][*]

Above the world, we're not too proud

For we're together, and what is there

A clumsy Joe who wouldn't know a Rhumba from a Waltz

The gentleman isn't bright; he doesn't know the score
A Cake will come; he'll take a crumb and never ask for more
The gentleman's eyes are blue, but little do they see

He's somebody else's problem; she's welcome to the guy

Marble halls, open doors
Someone found the key
And it's only what you do
That keeps coming back on you
And it's only what you say
That can give yourself away
'Cause it's easier to try
Than to prove it can't be done
And it's easier to stay
Than to turn around and run

It's a blue world
It takes somebody to help somebody
Oh, it's a blue world
It's a new world
It needs somebody to love somebody
Oh, it's a blue world
It's a blue world
It takes somebody to help somebody
Oh, it's a blue world
It's a new world
It needs somebody to love somebody
Oh, it's a blue world",It's a Blue World
Ella Fitzgerald,"It's a pity to say goodnight
Because I never saw stars so bright
But if gotta go home, you gotta go home
Give me a goodnight kiss

It's a pity to say farewell
Because the man in the moon won't tell
But if gotta go home, you gotta go home
Give me a goodnight kiss

How's about tomorrow night just you and me?
I'll be waiting for you darling 
Underneath the apple tree

It's a pity to say goodnight
Because I want you to hold me tight
But if gotta go home, you gotta go home
Give me a goodnight kiss",It's a Pity to Say Goodnight
Ella Fitzgerald,"Once she dressed in silks and lace, Owned a Rolls Royce car
Now she seems quite out of place, like a fallen star
Draped around my kitchen sink , Happy as can be
I just have to stop and think, Why she fell for me.

I'm not much to look at, nothing to see
Just glad I'm livin' and lucky to be
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

I can't save a dollar, ain't worth a cent
She doesn't holler she'd live in a tent
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

Tho' she loves to work and slave for me ev'ry day
She'd be so much better off if I went away.

But why should I leave her, why should I go
She'd be unhappy without me I know
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

She should have the very best, Anyone can see
Still she's diff'rent from the rest, satisfied with me.
While I worry plan and scheme, Over what to do
Can't help feeling it's a dream, Too good to be true. 

Never had nothin'; no one to care
That's why I seem to have more than my share,
I got a woman, crazy for me,
She's funny that way.

When I hurt her feelings, once in a while,
Her only answer is one little smile,
I got a woman crazy for me.
She's funny that way.

I can see no other way and no better plan,
End it all and let her go to some better man;
But I'm only human, coward at best
I'm more than certain she'd follow me west,
I got a woman crazy for me,
She's funny that way.",She's Funny That Way
Ella Fitzgerald,"Midnight, you heavy laden, it's midnight
Come on and trade in your old dreams for new
Your new dreams for old
I know where they're bought
I know where they're sold
Midnight, you've got to get there at midnight
And you'll be met there by others like you
Brothers as blue
Smiling on the street of dreams
 
Love laughs at a king
Kings don't mean a thing
On the street of dreams
Dreams broken in two can be made like new 
On the street of dreams
Gold, sliver and gold
All you can hold is in the moonbeams
Poor, no one is poor
Long as love is sure
On the street of dreams
 
Midnight, look at the steeple, it's midnight
Unhappy people, it's ringing with joy
It's ringing with cheer
'Cause yesterday's gone
Tomorrow is near
Midnight, the heart is lighter at midnight
Things will be brighter the moment you find
More of your kind
Smiling on the street of dreams
 
Love laughs at a king
Kings don't mean a thing
On the street of dreams

Poor, no one is poor
Long as love is sure

Ella Fitzgerald,"The very thought of you and I forget to do
The little ordinary things that everyone ought to do
I'm living in a kind of daydream
I'm happy as a king
And foolish though it may seem
To me that's everything

The mere idea of you, the longing here for you
You'll never know how slow the moments go till Im near to you
I see your face in every flower
Your eyes in stars above
Its just the thought of you
The very thought of you, my love

The mere idea of you, the longing here for you

Ella Fitzgerald,"Now we'll say till something do us part
That old dad of mine ain't got a heart
Any girl who's out for pleasure
Thinks of marriage only at her leisure
As it is, they've got the horse behind the cart

When my pop said we must wed,
He kind of wowed me, still I'm read-y
But one thing must be clear
At this time

I'll be hard to handle
I promise you that
And if you complain
Here's one little Jane
Who'll leave you flat

I'll be hard to handle
What else can I be
I say with a shrug
I think you're a mug
To marry me

When you first threw me a gander
I was willing to philander
But I never thought I'd have to be a bride
Now you're gonna find tough sledding
I don't want no shotgun wedding
I was only along for the ride

I'll be hard to handle
I'm telling you plain
Just be a dear
And scram out of here
I'm gonna raise cain

I'll be hard to handle
My bridges are burned
This wedding's a gag
And you're in the bag
Where I'm concerned

I'll be hard to handle
When we've said, ""I do""
See there's no hope
I just got a dope
When I took you

I'll be living my life in bed
But they always will be twin beds
And I warn you, you'll be living like a monk
Our affair is now a past one
So don't think you've pulled a fast one
Just remember, I think you're a punk!

I'll be hard to handle
I'm no ball and chain
I'll find some means
To call the Marines
I'm gonna raise cain

Gonna raise cain
I'm telling you plain
I'm gonna raise cain",I'll Be Hard to Handle
Ella Fitzgerald,"I am not such a clever one
About the latest fads
I admit I was never one
Adored by local lads

Not that I ever try to be a saint
I'm the type that they classify as quaint

I'm old fashioned
I love the moonlight
I love the old fashioned things

The sound of rain
Upon a window pane
The starry song that April sings

This year's fancies
Are passing fancies
But sighing sighs holding hands
These my heart understands

I know I'm old fashioned
But I don't mind it
That's how I want to be
As long as you agree
To stay old fashioned with me

I'm old fashioned
But I don't mind it
That's how I want to be

Oh please stay old fashioned with me",I'm Old Fashioned
Ella Fitzgerald,"Before I met you no one attracted me
No love thoughts worried or distracted me
My disposition kept exempting me
Until you started in preempting me

And all this while, you've really been tempting me
Maybe you can tell me what we ought to do

Now that you've got me going, what you gonna do?
Is it up to me? Is it up to you?
What kind of game is this we've begun?
Was it done, just for fun?

We have necked, till I'm wrecked
Won't you tell me what you expect?
Is this to be a case of kiss and never tell?
Folly and farewell
Heaven or maybe hell

Which is it going to be, love or gin?
Wife or sin? Let's begin

Ella Fitzgerald,"Turn off that charm
I'm through with love for awhile
I'm through and yet, you have a fabulous smile
So if I forget

Remind me
Not to find you so attractive
Remind me
That the world is full of men

When I start to miss you
To touch your hand
To kiss you
Remind me
To count to ten

I had a feeling when I met you
You'd drive me crazy if I let you
But all my efforts to forget you
Remind me I'm in love again

I get my heart, well in hand, and I'm certain
That I can take you, or leave you alone
Then you begin that beguine again
And boom, I give in , again
I have a will made of steel, my friend
But when it seems about to bend

Remind me
Not to mention that I love you
Remind me
To be sorry that we met

Although I adore you
Remind me to ignore you
You're one thing I will regret

So when your charm begins to blind me
I'll simply tie my hands behind me
Don't let me kiss you please, remind me
Unless, my darling, you forget",Remind Me
Ella Fitzgerald,"She didn't say yes
She didn't say no

She only knew that he had spied her there
And then she knew he sat beside her there

Yes you're lovely, with your smile so warm
And your cheeks so soft,
There is nothing for me but to love you,
And the way you look tonight.
With each word your tenderness grows,
Tearing my fear apart

And that laugh that wrinkles your nose,
It touches my foolish heart.

Ella Fitzgerald,"I am not the only traveler
Who has not repaid his debt
I've been searching for a trail to follow again
Take me back to the night we met

And then I can tell myself
What the hell I'm supposed to do
And then I can tell myself
Not to ride along with you

I had all and then most of you
Some and now none of you
Take me back to the night we met
I don't know what I'm supposed to do
Haunted by the ghost of you
Oh, take me back to the night we met

When the night was full of terrors
And your eyes were filled with tears
When you had not touched me yet

Ella Fitzgerald,"Oh, how I love him
But he just doesn't see

Tall and tan and young and handsome
The boy from Ipanema goes walking
And when he passes
Each girl he passes goes, ah

When he walks
He's like a samba
That swings so cool and sways so gentle
That when he passes each girl
He passes goes, ah

Oh, but I watch him so sadly
How can I tell him I love him?
Yes, I would give my heart gladly
But each day
When he walks to the sea
He looks straight ahead, not at me

And when he passes goes, ah

That same old pounding in my heart, whenever I think of you

When I awake I get up with a tingle

In the sunny South when I was a tot so high
And now that I have grown
And myself alone

Cradle me where Southern skies
Can watch me with a million eyes

Cover me with Heaven's blue
And let me dream a dream or two

And in the hustle and bustle, no sunshine appears
But you and I have our love always there to remind us
There is a way we can leave all the shadows behind us
Volare, oh, oh! Cantare, oh, oh, oh, oh!
Let's fly way up to the clouds, away from the maddening crowds
We can sing in the glow of a star that I know of
Where lovers enjoy peace of mind
Let us leave the confusion and all disillusion behind
Just like birds of a feather a rainbow together we'll find

Ella Fitzgerald,"When an early autumn walks the land and chills the breeze
And touches with her hand the summer trees,
Perhaps you'll understand what memories I own.
There's a dance pavilion in the rain all shuttered down,

A winding country lane all russet brown,
A frosty window pane shows me a town grown lonely.
That spring of ours that started so April-hearted,
Seemed made for just a boy and girl.

I never dreamed, did you, any fall would come in view
So early, early.
Darling if you care, please, let me know,
I'll meet you anywhere, I miss you so.
Let's never have to share another early autumn.",Early Autumn
Ella Fitzgerald,"You know the feeling of something half remembered
Of something that never happened, yet you recall it well
You know the feeling of recognizing someone
That you've never met as far as you could tell, well

Laura is the face in the misty light
Footsteps that you hear down the hall
The laugh that floats on a summer night
That you can never quite recall
And you see Laura on the train that is passing through
Those eyes, how familiar they seem
She gave your very first kiss to you
That was Laura but she's only a dream",Laura [From Laura]

And so, I'm borrowing a love song from the birds
To tell you that you're marvelous
Too marvelous for words

Ella Fitzgerald,"Maybe he's not much, just another man
Doing what he can
But what does she care
When a woman loves a man?

She'll just string along
All through thick and thin
Till his ship comes in
It's always that way

When a woman love a man
She'll be the first one to praise him
When he's goin' strong
The last one to blame him

When everything's wrong
It's such a one-sided game that they play
But women are funny that way
Tell her she's a fool

She'll say, ""yes, I know""

Get what I want--I know how

One throw, that bell will go clang

Eye on the target and wham
One shot, one gun shot, and bam

Brought tidings of the same
How bad in Bethlehem was born

It is the night of the dear Savior's birth
Long lay the world in sin and error pining
Till He appeared and the soul felt its worth

For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn

Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.

For Christ is born of Mary, and gathered all above
While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

What's the use of swank and cash in the bank galore?

Mere alcohol doesn't thrill me at all
So tell me, why should it be true
That I get a kick out of you?
Some get a kick from cocaine
I'm sure that if I took even one sniff
That would bore me terrifically too
But I get a kick out of you

I get a kick though it's clear to me
You obviously don't adore me

Is my idea of nothing to do

At the thought I was foolish and proud
And let you say goodbye

And one day
From my infinite sadness you came
And brought me love again

That no matter whatever befalls
I'll never let you go

I will hold you close
Make you stay
Because love is the saddest thing
When it goes away

Ella Fitzgerald,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said, ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions, but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams

To jump into the ocean

A very strange, enchanted boy

Over land and sea

And while we spoke of many things
Fools and kings
This he said to me

Is just to love and be loved in return""

Silver waves that break on some undiscovered shore

Long winter nights with the candles gleaming

I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill I'd never known
When you smiled, and then the spell was cast
And here we are in Heaven, I found my love at last

Ella Fitzgerald,"The boys watch the girls while the girls watch the boys who watch the girls go by
Eye to eye, they solemnly convene to make the scene
Which is the name of the game, watch a guy watch a dame on any street in town
Up and down and over and across, romance is boss

Guys talk ""girl talk"", it happens everywhere
Eyes watch girls walk with tender lovin' care

It's keepin' track of the fact watching them watching back 
That makes the world go 'round
""What's that sound?"" each time you hear a loud collective sigh
They're making music to watch girls by

Ella Fitzgerald,"I may be wrong, but I think you're wonderful
I may be wrong, but I think you're swell
I like your style; say, I think it's marvelous
I'm always wrong, so how can I tell?

Deuces to me are all aces

Ella Fitzgerald,"Speak low when you speak, love
Our summer day withers away too soon, too soon
Speak low when you speak, love
Our moment is swift; like ships adrift, we're swept apart too soon

Speak low, darling, speak low
Love is a spark lost in the dark too soon, too soon
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here and always too soon

Time is so old and love so brief
Love is pure gold and time a thief

We're late, darling, we're late
The curtain descends, everything ends too soon, too soon
I wait, darling, I wait
Will you speak low to me? Speak love to me and soon

Time is so old and love so brief

Ella Fitzgerald,"I feel the autumn breeze; it steals cross my pillow
As soft as a will-o'-the-wisp and in its song
There is sadness because there's no you

The lonely autumn trees, how softly they're sighing
'Cause summer is dying; they know that in my heart
There's no gladness because there's no you

The park that we walked in, the garden we talked in
How lonesome they seem in the fall
The stormy clouds hover and falling leaves cover
Our favorite nook in the wall

In spring we'll meet again; we'll kiss and recapture 
The summertime rapture we knew and from that day
Never more will I say, ""There's no you""

It's gone away from me

The thrill is gone away from me
Although, I'll still live on
But so lonely I'll be

The thrill is gone
It's gone away for good

It's gone away for good
Someday I know I'll be open-armed, baby

Ella Fitzgerald,"Out of the tree of life I just picked me a plum
You came along and everything's startin' to hum
Still, it's a real good bet, the best is yet to come
Best is yet to come and babe, won't that be fine?
You think you've seen the sun, but you ain't seen it shine
Wait till the warm-up's underway
Wait till our lips have met
And wait till you see that sunshine day
You ain't seen nothin' yet
The best is yet to come and babe, won't it be fine?
Best is yet to come, come the day you're mine
Come the day you're mine
I'm gonna teach you to fly
We've only tasted the wine
We're gonna drain the cup dry
Wait till your charms are right for these arms to surround
You think you've flown before, but baby, you ain't left the ground
Wait till you're locked in my embrace
Wait till I draw you near
Wait till you see that sunshine place
Ain't nothin' like it here

Ella Fitzgerald,"Time and again I've longed for adventure,
Something to make my heart beat the faster.
What did I long for? I never really knew.
Finding your love I've found my adventure,
Touching your hand, my heart beats the faster,
All that I want in all of this world is you.

You are the promised kiss of springtime
That makes the lonely winter seem long.
You are the breathless hush of evening
That trembles on the brink of a lovely song.

You are the angel glow that lights a star,
The dearest things I know are what you are.
Some day my happy arms will hold you,
And some day I'll know that moment divine,
When all the things you are, are mine!",All the Things You Are
Ella Fitzgerald,"Oh listen, sister,
I love my mister man,
And I can't tell yo' why,
There ain't no reason
Why I should love that man.
It must be something that the angels done plan.

Fish got to swim, birds got to fly,
I got to love one man till I die.
Can't help loving that man of mine.
Tell me he's lazy, tell me he's slow,
Tell me I'm crazy (maybe I know).
Can't help loving that man of mine.
When he goes away
That's a rainy day,
But when he comes back that day is fine,
The sun will shine!
He kin come home as late as kin be,
Home without him ain't no home to me.
Can't help loving that man of mine.

My man is shiftless
An' good for nothing too
(He's my man just the same)

He's never round here
When there is work to do.
He's never round here when there's working to do.
The chimbley's smoking,
The roof is leaking in,
But he don't seem to care.
He kin be happy
With just a sip of gin.
Ah even love him when his kisses got gin!",Can't Help Lovin' Dat Man
Ella Fitzgerald,"Got a little rhythm, a rhythm, a rhythm
That pit a pats through my brain
So darn persistent
The day isn't distant
When it'll drive me insane
Comes in the morning
Without any warning
And hangs around me all day
I'll have to sneak up to it
Someday, and speak up to it
I hope it listens when I say

Fascinating rhythm
You've got me on the go
Fascinating rhythm
I'm all a quiver

What a mess you're making
The neighbors want to know
Why I'm always shaking
Just like a fliver

Each morning I get up with the sun
Start a hopping
Never stopping
To find at night no work has been done

I know that
Once it didn't matter
But now you're doing wrong
When you start to patter
I'm so unhappy

Won't you take a day off
Decide to run along
Somewhere far away off
And make it snappy

Oh, how I long to be the girl I used to be

Oh won't you stop picking on me

I know that
Once it didn't matter
But now you're doing wrong

I felt it happened
I was awake
I wasn't blind
I didn't think

Now I believe in matter over mind.
And now you see we mustn't wait
The nearest moment that we marry is too late!
Have you met Miss Jones
Someone said as we shook hands
She was just Miss Jones to me
Then I said Miss Jones
You're a girl who understand
I'm a boy who must be free.
And all at once I lost my breath
And all at once was scared to death
And all at once I hold the eatrh and sky!

And we'll keep on meeting till we die

Ella Fitzgerald,"I've wined and dined on Mulligan Stew, and never wished for Turkey
As I hitched and hiked and grifted too, from Maine to Albuquerque
Alas, I missed the Beaux Arts Ball, and what is twice as sad
I was never at a party where they honored Noel Ca-ad
But social circles spin too fast for me
My ""hobohemia"" is the place to be

I get too hungry, for dinner at eight
I like the theater, but never come late
I never bother, with people I hate
That's why the lady is a tramp

I don't like crap games, with barons and earls
Won't go to Harlem, in ermine and pearls
Won't dish the dirt, with the rest of the girls
That's why the lady is a tramp

I like the free, fresh wind in my hair
Life without care
I'm broke, it's OK
Hate California, it's cold and it's damp
That's why the lady is a tramp

I go to Coney, the beach is divine
I go to ballgames, the bleachers are fine
I follow Winchell, and read every line
That's why the lady is a tramp

I like a prizefight, that isn't a fake
I love the rowing, on Central Park lake
I go to Opera and stay wide awake
That's why the lady is a tramp

I like the green grass under my shoes
What can I lose, I'm flat, that's that
I'm alone when I lower my lamp
That's why the lady is a tramp",The Lady Is a Tramp
Ella Fitzgerald,"Laura is the face in the misty lights
Footsteps that you hear down the hall
The laugh that floats on a summer night
That you can never quite recall

And you see Laura on the train that is passing through
Those eyes how familiar they seem
She gave your very first kiss to you
That was Laura but she's only a dream

Ella Fitzgerald,"Behold the way our fine feathered friend,
His virtue doth parade
Thou knowest not, my dim-witted friend
The picture thou hast made
Thy vacant brow, and thy tousled hair
Conceal thy good intent
Thou noble upright truthful sincere,
And slightly dopey gent

You're my funny valentine,
Sweet comic valentine,
You make me smile with my heart.
Your looks are laughable, un-photographable,
Yet, you're my favorite work of art.

Is your figure less than Greek?
Is your mouth a little weak?
When you open it to speak, are you smart?
But, don't change a hair for me.
Not if you care for me.
Stay little valentine, stay!

Ella Fitzgerald,"The man who only lives for making money
Lives a life that isn't necessarily sunny
Likewise the man who works for fame
There's no guarantee
That time won't erase his name

The fact is, the only work
That really brings enjoyment
Is the kind that is for girl and boy meant
Fall in love, you won't regret it
That's the best work of all, if you can get it

Holding hands at midnight
'Neath a starry sky
Nice work if you can get it
And you can get it if you try

Strolling with the one girl
Sighing sigh after sigh
Nice work if you can get it
And you can get it if you try

Just imagine someone
Waiting at the cottage door
Where two hearts become one
Who could ask for anything more

Loving one who loves you
And then taking that vow
Nice work if you can get it
And if you get it, won't you tell me how

It's terribly sad but true
All dressed up, no place to go
Each evening I'm awfully blue
I must win some handsome guy
Can't go on like this
I could blossom out I know
With somebody just like you, so

Oh, sweet and lovely
Lady be good
Oh lady be good to me
I am so awfully misunderstood
So lady be good, to me
Oh, please have some pity
I'm all alone in this big city
I tell you I'm just
A lonesome babe in the wood
So lady be good to me

Oh, please have some pity

Ella Fitzgerald,"Skylark
Have you anything to say to me?
Won't you tell me where my love can be?
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Skylark
Have you seen a valley green with spring?
Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

And in your lonely flight
Haven't you heard the music in the night?
Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

Oh skylark
I don't know if you can find these things
But my heart is riding on your wings
So if you see them anywhere
Won't you lead me there?

All by myself in the night

The decks are trimmed with gold
And of jam and spice there's a paradise in the hold

My ship's aglow with a million pearls
And rubies fill each bin
The sun sits high in a sapphire sky when my ship comes in

I can wait the years
Till it appears
One fine day one spring
But the pearls and such
They won't mean much if there's missing just one thing

I do not care if that day arrives

My own true love to me
If the ship I sing doesn't also bring my own true love to me",My Ship

I could kiss the ground on Green Dolphin Street
 
Lover, one lovely day
Love came, planning to stay
Green Dolphin Street supplied the setting
The setting for nights beyond forgetting
And through these moments apart memories live in my heart
When I recall the love I found on

I am yours for the asking, darling
Any old time you need me
I'll be there with love that's lasting, darling
All through the years we'll stand together
Sharing the tears and stormy weather
And the sunshine will be yours and mine
Any old time you're blue
You'll have our love to chase away the blues

And I find you spinning 'round in my
Brain
Like the bubbles in a glass of champagne
You go to my head like a sip of sparkling Burgundy brew

And I find the very mention of you
Like the kicker in a julep or two

The thrill of the thought that
You might give a thought to my plea
Cast a spell over me
Still I say to myself get a hold of
Yourself
Can't you see that it never can be

You go to my head with a smile that makes my temperature
Rise
Like a summer with a thousand Julies
You intoxicate my soul with your eyes

That this heart of mine
Hasn't a ghost of a chance in this crazy romance

You go to",You Go to My Head

Waiting for the plane to leave
And the captain says, ""There'll be a short delay
Bear with me, please""

They gave us the usual hassle
""You can't take those guitars on board""
But the boys in the band just smiled
Heard it all before

And as they're starting to serve champagne
To the folks at the front of the plane
I can hear the engines roaring
We're on our way

And we are flying home
I feel the freedom in my soul
Flying home at last
Flying home
I've got the freedom in my soul

And it's four in the morning
My world is calling
Speeding through the universe tonight

The movie reminds of my lady
As she waits, ""Where are those guys?""
Yes, it's nice to see old Butch and Sundance in the sky

And now the sun is beginning to rise
It's like looking down on Paradise
There's a ball of fire that's burning
Giving life

And we are flying home

While the wind is sobbing
Underneath the stars

Like two guitars

Let me dream forever

You can see a distant steeple
Not a sign of people, who
wants people?

We'll creep into our little shell
And we will thank the small hotel together",There's a Small Hotel

It brings back a night of tropical splendor

And down by the shore, an orchestra`s playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember

As Juliet cried, in her Romeo's ear
""Romeo, why not face the fact, my dear""

It was just one of those things
Just one of those crazy flings
One of those bells that now and then rings
Just one of those things

It was just one of those nights
Just one of those fabulous flights
A trip to the moon on gossamer wings
Just one of those things

If we'd thought a bit, of the end of it
When we started painting the town
We'd have been aware that our love affair
It was too hot, not to cool down

So good-bye, dear, and amen
Here's hoping we meet now and then
It was great fun
But it was just one of those things

If we'd thought a bit, of the end of it
When we started painting the town
We'd have been aware that our love affair
Was too hot, not to cool down

So good-bye, dear, and amen
Here's hoping we meet now and then
It was great fun
But it was just one of those things

Madam
Miss Otis regrets she's unable to lunch today
She is sorry to be delayed
But last evening down in Lover's Lane she strays
Madam
Miss Otis regrets she's unable to lunch today

When she woke up and found that her dream of love was gone
Madam
She ran to the man who had led her so far astray
And from under her velvet gown
She drew a gun and shot her love down

Miss Otis regrets, she's unable to lunch today

When the mob came and got her and dragged her from the jail

They strung her upon the old willow across the way
And the moment before she died
She lifted up her lovely head and cried

I'm as helpless as a kitten up a tree;
And I feel like I'm clingin' to a cloud,
I can' t understand
I get misty, just holding your hand.

Walk my way,
And a thousand violins begin to play,
Or it might be the sound of your hello,
That music I hear,
I get misty, the moment you're near.

Can't you see that you're leading me on? 
And it's just what I want you to do,
Don't you notice how hopelessly
I'm lost
That's why I'm following you.

On my own,
When I wander through this wonderland alone,
Never knowing my right foot from my left
My hat from my glove
I'm too misty, and too much in love.

Too misty,
And too much
In love",Misty [Live In Berlin 1960]
Ella Fitzgerald,"A fine romance, with no kisses
A fine romance, my friend this is
We should be like a couple of hot tomatoes
But you're as cold as yesterday's mashed potatoes
A fine romance, you won't nestle
A fine romance, you won't wrestle
I might as well play bridge
With my old maid aunt
I haven't got a chance
This is a fine romance

A fine romance, my good fellow
You take romance, I'll take jello
You're calmer than the seals
In the arctic ocean
At least they flap their fins
To express emotion
A fine romance with no quarrels
With no insults and all morals
I've never mussed the crease
In your blue serge pants
I never get the chance
This is a fine romance",A Fine Romance [*]
Ella Fitzgerald,"How long, baby how long,
Has that evening train been gone?
How long, how how long, baby how long?

Went to the station, didn't see no train.
Down in my heart, I have an aching pain.
How long, how how long, baby how long?

I feel disgusted, I feel so bad
Thinking 'bout the good time that I once have had.
How long, how how long, baby how long?

I could see the green grass growing on the hill;
I ain't seen no greenback on a dollar bill.
How long, how how long, baby how long?

You're gonna be sorry, you'll feel so blue.
When you want me, baby, I declare I won't want you.
How long, how how long, baby how long?

Don't have no money for to ride the train.
I would ride the rods, baby, to be with you again.

Must I keep my, my watch in pawn?

Don't need what money can buy
Birds in the trees sing their dayful of songs
Why shouldn't we sing along
I'm chipper all the day

Look at what I've got

I got rhythm, I got music, I got my man

And I had nothing but shadows
Then one morning you passed
And I brightened at last
Now I greet the day and complete the day
With the sun in my heart
All my worry blew away
When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street

I used to walk in the shade
With those blues on parade
But I'm not afraid

It gets you high, it gets you low, but once you get that glow...

Here`s to the boys I've kissed, and to complete the list
Here`s to the boys who said ""No!""

Who was ever too blase for love
Make this the night for love

Ah, but in Pa-ree they die for love
Some waste away for love
Just the same - hooray for love!

It`s the rocket to the moon, with a touch of ""Clare de Lune""
It gets you high, it gets you low, but once you get that glow...

Some trust to fate for love,
Others have to take off weight for love
Some go berserk for love
Loafers even go to work for love

Sad songs are sobbed for love
People have their noses bobbed for love
Some say we pay for love

And never further south than the aquarium
I've seen the charm of Jersey City, but first let me remark
I saw it from the Empire State Solarium

But we've been putting nickels in the postal savings bank
And when those nickels pile up, we can toddle off in swank
And I don't mean an ordinary cook's tour
I mean a cabin deluxe tour

New lands and new faces
The day we quit punching the clock
The future looks pleasant
But at present

I want at Grand Canyon
For throwing old blades down the rock
The money we have`ll go for travel
Meantime, let's walk around the block

Gangway, we'll begin
When our, ship comes in
I'll sit on your lap
All over the map

To London in may time
To Venice in play time
To Paris in time for a frock
To Boston in bean time
Darling, meantime
Let's take a walk around the block

In winter at Christmas
We'll visit the isthmus
And see how they lock up a lock
And then in Caracas, on a jackass
We'll take a ride around the block

We'll keep to our promise
To visit St. Thomas
And then at Jamaica we'll dock
The prospect is thrilling
Still I am willing
Just now to walk around the block

Onward, to Cathay
Then to Mandalay
Boom on to Bangkok

Buy souvenirs till we're in hock

The winds grow colder,

The writing`s on the wall,
The dreams you dreamed have all
Gone astray.
The man that won you
Has run off and undone you.
That great beginning
Has seen it`s final inning,
Don`t know what happened
It`s all a crazy game.

And never a new love will
Be the same.

Ella Fitzgerald,"Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?

Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high

And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.

Ella Fitzgerald,"When the sun comes out
And that rain stops beatin' on my window pane
When the sun comes out
There'll be bluebirds 'round my door, singin' like they did before

That ol' storm broke out
And my man
Gal walked off and left me in the rain
Though he's
She's gone I doubt
If he'll
She'll stay away for good,I'd stop livin' if he/she should

Love is funny, it's not always peaches, cream and honey
Just when everything looked bright and sunny
Suddenly the cyclone came, I'll never be the same

Til that sun comes out
And the rain stops beatin' on my window pane
If my heart holds out
Let it rain and let it pour, it may not be long before
There's a knockin' at my door
Then you'll know the one I love walked in
When the sun comes out",When the Sun Comes Out
Ella Fitzgerald,"The days of wine and roses laugh and run away like a child at play
Through a meadowland toward a closing door
A door marked ""nevermore"" that wasn't there before

The lonely night discloses just a passing breeze filled with memories
Of the golden smile that introduced me to
The days of wine and roses and you

Of the golden smile that introduced me to
The days of wine and roses and you",Days of Wine and Roses
Ella Fitzgerald,"Though you vacation in Hawaii
Or go to Switzerland to ski
When you're scanning the snow-covered mountain
Or fanning yourself by the sea
Don't dream of anybody but me

Though you may fly the Scottish Highlands
Or take a trip to some isle near Napoli
When you're whistling ""The Campbells Are Coming""
Or humming ""The Isle Of Capri""
Don't dream of anybody but me

In a cafe on the Rhine
Any place along the line
I'll forgive you when a stranger
Puts your little heart in danger
If his face resembles mine

When a guy at a mike in a nightclub
Begins bellowing something off-key
Won't even mind if suddenly he reminds you of me

No matter where you care to roam
Doesn't even matter whom you choose to see
Whenever your head hits that pillow
Whatever the hour may be
Don't dream of anybody but me
Don't dream of anybody but me
Don't dream of anybody but me",Don't Dream of Anybody But Me

Ella Fitzgerald,"Everyday brings change, and the world puts on a new face
Sudden things rearrange, and this whole world seems like a new place
Oh yeah, secretly I been tailing you
Like a fox that prays on a rabbit
Had to get you and so I knew
I had to learn your ways and habits
Oh, you were the catch that I was after
But I looked up and I was in your arms and I knew that I was captured

What's this whole world comin' to
Things just ain't the same
Any time the hunter gets captured by the game

I had to lay such a tender trap
Hoping you might fall into it
Love hit me like a sudden slap
One kiss and then I knew it
Oh, my plans didn't work out like I thought
'Cause I had laid my trap for you but it seems like I got caught

Ella Fitzgerald,"I bet you're wonderin' how I knew
'Bout your plans to make me blue
With some other guy you knew before 
Between the two of us guys 
You know I loved you more
It took me by surprise I must say 
When I found out yesterday 
Don't you know that I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine
Oh I heard it through the grapevine
Oh I'm just about to lose my mind
 
Honey, honey yeah.
I heard it through the grapevine 
Not much longer would you be mine baby
 
I know a man ain't supposed to cry 
But these tears I can't hold inside
Losin' you would end my life you see
'Cause you mean that much to me
You could have told me yourself 
That you loved some one else
Instead I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine
Oh, I heard it through the grapevine
And I'm just about to lose my mind
 
Honey, honey yeah
I heard it through the grapevine 
Not much longer would you be mine, baby
 
People say believe half of what you see
Son and none of what you hear
But I can't help but be confused
If it's true please tell me dear
Do you plan to let me go
For the other guy you loved before?

Don't you know I heard it through the grapevine

Ella Fitzgerald,"What do you get when you fall in love?
A guy with a pin to burst your bubble
That's what you get for all your trouble
I'll never fall in love again

What do you get when you kiss a guy?
You get enough germs to catch pneumonia
After you do, he'll never phone you
I'll never fall in love again

Above the world
We're not too proud to cling together
We're strong as long as we're together

The starless nights were not in vain
For we're together
And what is there to fear together

Be a clown, be a clown
All the world loves a clown
Act the fool, play the calf
And you'll always have the last laugh

Wear the cap and the bells
And you'll rate with all the great swells

If you become a dentist, they'll be glad when you're dead
You'll get a bigger hand if you can stand on your head

Be a clown, be a clown
All the world loves a clown
Show 'em tricks, tell 'em jokes
And you'll only stop with top folks

Be a crack Jackanapes
And they'll imitate you like apes
Why be a great composer with your rent in arrears
Why be a major poet and you'll owe it for years
When crowds'll pay to giggle if you wiggle your ears
Be a clown, be a clown, be a clown

Be a clown, be a clown
All the world loves a clown
If you just make 'em roar
Watch your Mounte bank account soar

Wear a painted mustache
And you're sure to make a big splash
A college education I should never propose
A bachelor's degree won't even keep you in clothes
But millions you will win if you can spin on your nose
Be a clown, be a clown, be a clown

Give 'em quips, give 'em fun
And they'll happy to say you're A-1

If you become a gambler you'll be stuck with your luck
But Jack you'll never lack if you can quack like a duck

Wishing is good time wasted,
Still it's a habit they say,
Wishing for sweet's I've tasted,
That's all I do all day.
Maybe there's nothing in wishing,
But, speaking of wishing I'll say,

Nothing could be finer
Than to be in Carolina
In the morning.

No one could be sweeter
Than my sweetie when I meet her
In the morning.

When the morning glories
Twine around the door
Whispering pretty stories
I long to hear once more
Strolling with my girlie
Where the dew is pearly early
In the morning.

Butterflies all flutter up
And kiss each little buttercup
At dawning.
If I had Aladdin's lamp
For only a day
I'd make a wish
And here's what I'd say

Nothing could be finer
Than to be in Carolina
In the morning.

Dreaming was meant for night time
I live in dreams all the day, 
I know it's not the right time,
But still I dream away
What could be sweeter than dreaming,
Just dreaming and drift away. 

Nothing could be finer
Than to be in Carolina
In the morning.

No one could be sweeter
Than my sweetie when I meet her
In the morning.

Strolling with my girlie
Where the dew is pearly early

Our beautiful garden has withered away,
Where you planted roses,the weeds seem to say,

From every single window, I see your face,

Does July need a sky of blue?
Would I miss you, would I?

If the sun should desert the day,
What would life be?
Will I leave you, never?
Could the ocean leave the shore?
Will I worship you for ever?

The time has come to take, your love-torn hearts off your sleeve
Look, look about you, what, what do you see?
Love-sick, love-lorn, love-wrecked, love-worn, boo hoomanity

There'll be no peace on Earth Until this curse
Is wiped off from this love-mapped universe
Are we mice or are we men? Can't you see the light?
Come you fellow victims lets unite

Down with love, the flowers and rice and shoes
Down with love, the root of all midnight blues
Down with things that give you that well-known pain
Take that mood and wrap it in cellophane

Down with love, let's liquidate all its friends
Moon and June and roses and rainbows ends
Down with songs that mourn about night and day
Down with love, just take it away, away
Take it away, take it away

Give it back to the birds and the bees and the V and E's
Down with Eyes romantic and stupid
Down with signs, down with Cupid
Ruttle that stuff that duff

Down with love
Down with love

Down, down, down with love",Down With Love
Judy Garland,"Don't ever leave me, now, that you're here
Here is where you belong

Don't ever leave me 'cause if you do
I'll have no one to run to",Fly Me to the Moon
Judy Garland,"I was a stranger in the city  
Out of town were the people I knew  
I had that feeling of self-pity  
What to do? What to do? What to do?  
The outlook was decidedly blue  
But as I walked through the foggy streets alone  
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day in London Town  
Had me low and had me down  
I viewed the morning with alarm  
The British Museum had lost its charm  
How long, I wondered, could this thing last?  
But the age of miracles hadn't passed,  
For, suddenly, I saw you there 
And through foggy London Town  
The sun was shining everywhere.",A Foggy Day
Judy Garland,"From this moment on,
You for me dear,
Only two for tea dear,
From this moment on,

From this happy day,
No more blue songs,
Only hoop-de-doo songs,

You've got the love I need so much
Got the skin I love to touch
Got the arms to hold me tight
Got the sweet lips to kiss me goodnight

From this moment on
You and I babe
We'll be ridin' high babe
Every care is gone

Judy Garland,"It seems like happiness is just a thing called Joe
He's got a smile that makes the lilac wanta grow
He's got a way that makes the angels heave a sigh
When they know little Joe's passing by

Sometimes the cabin's gloomy and the table's bare
Then he'll kiss me and it's Christmas everywhere
Troubles fly away and life is easy go
Does he love me good, that's all I need to know

Seems like happiness, is just a thing called Joe

Judy Garland,"Hey look me over, lend me an ear
Fresh out of clover, mortgage up to here
Don't pass the plate folks, don't pass the cup
I figure whenever you're down and out, the only way is up
And I'll be up like a rosebud high on the vine
Don't thumb your nose, but take a tip from mine
I'm a little bit short of the elbow room, so let me get me some
And look out world, here I come

Nobody in the world was ever without a prayer
How can you win the world if nobody knows you're there?

Kid, when you need the crowd, the tickets are hard to sell
Still, you can lead the crowd if you can get up and yell

Hey look me over, lend me an ear
Fresh out of clover, mortgage up to here
I'm a little bit short of the elbow room, so let me get me some
And look out world, here me shout world

This is where our story ends,
Never lovers, ever friends.

Goodbye, Let our hearts call it a day,
But before you walk away,
I sincerely want to say:

I wish you bluebirds in the Spring,
To give your heart a song to sing;
And then a kiss, but more than this I wish you love.

And in July, a lemonade,
To cool you in some leafy glade;
I wish you health and more than wealth, I wish you love.
My breaking heart and I agree
That you and I could never be,
So with my best, my very best, I set you free.

I wish you shelter from the storm,
A cozy fire to keep you warm;

I wish you love.

Judy Garland,"Now gather round you sailor boys, and listen to my plea
And when you've heard my tale you'll pity me
For I was a real damned fool in the port of Liverpool
The first time that I came home from the sea

I was paid off at the Home, from a voyage to Sierra Leone
Two pounds ten and sixpence was my pay
When I drew the tin I grinned, but I very soon got skinned
By a girl by the name of Maggie May

Oh, Maggie, Maggie May, they've taken you away
They've sent you to Van Diemen's cruel shore
For you robbed so many a sailor, and skinned so many a whaler
And you'll never shine in Paradise Street no more

I shan't forget the day when I first met Maggie May
She was cruising up and down on Canning Place
With a figure so divine, like a frigate of the line
So, being a sailor, I gave chase

Oh, Maggie, Maggie May, they've taken you away
They've sent you to Van Diemen's cruel shore
For you robbed so many a sailor, and skinned so many a whaler
And you'll never shine in Paradise Street no more

Next day I woke in bed, with a sore and aching head
No shoes, or shirt, or trousers could I find
I asked her where they were, and she answered, ""My dear sir,
They're down in Kelly's knock-shop, number nine""

Oh, Maggie, Maggie May, they've taken you away
They've sent you to Van Diemen's cruel shore
For you robbed so many a sailor, and skinned so many a whaler
And you'll never shine in Paradise Street no more

Oh, you thieving Maggie May, you robbed me of my pay
When I slept with you last night ashore
And the judge he guilty found her of robbing a homeward-bounder
And she'll never roam down Paradise Street no more

Oh, Maggie, Maggie May, they've taken you away

To disregard convention

Nevertheless, they'll call it shameless

There's a gray lock or two in the brown of the hair
There's some silver in mine too, I see
But in all the long years
When the clouds brought their tears
Those two eyes o' blue
Kept smilin' through at me

I shall wait there to find

And then quite suddenly i saw you, and i dreamed of gay amours
At dawn i wake up singing sentimental overtures

I taste the wine of real romancing now

I like a Gershwin tune, how about you?
I love a fireside when a storm is due.
I like potato chips, moonlight and motor trips,
How about you?
I'm mad about good books, can't get my fill,
And Franklin Roosevelt's looks give me a thrill.
Holding hands at the movie show,
When all the lights are low
May not be new, but I like it,
How about you?

I like Jack Benny's jokes.
To a degree.
I love the common folks.
That includes me.
I like to window shop on 5th Avenue.
I like banana splits, late supper at the Ritz,
How about you?

Looks like we both agree

He hung up his coat and his hat,
He gazed all around, but no wifey he found,
So he said ""where can Flossie be at?""
A note on the table he spied,
He read it just once, then he cried
It ran, ""Louis dear, it's too slow for for me hear,
So I think I will go for a ride.""

""Meet me in St. Louis, Louis,
Meet me at the fair,

Were gone, she had taken them all,
She took all his rings and the rest of his things,

""Your rent is paid three months ahead.""
""What good is the flat?"" said poor Louis, ""Read that.""

There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.

Really do come true.

And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,

And my hair piled high upon my head
I went to lose a jolly hour on the trolley
And lost my heart instead
With his light brown derby and his bright green tie

I started to yen so I counted to ten 
Then I counted to ten again

Clang, clang, clang went the trolley
Ding, ding, ding went the bell
Zing, zing, zing went my heart strings
From the moment I saw him I fell
Chug, chug, chug went the motor
Bump, bump, bump went the brake
Thump, thump, thump went my heart strings
When he smiled I could feel the car shake
He tipped his hat, and took a seat
He said he hoped he hadn't stepped upon my feet
He asked my name, I held my breath
I couldn't speak because he scared me half to death

Buzz, buzz, buzz went the buzzer
Plop, plop, plop went the wheels
Stop, stop, stop went my heart strings
As he started to go then I started to know how it feels
When the universe reels

The day was bright, the air was sweet
The smell of honeysuckle charmed you off your feet
You tried to sing, but couldn't squeak
In fact you loved him so you couldn't even speak

Buzz, buzz, buzz went the buzzer
Plop, plop, plop went the wheels
Stop, stop, stop went my heart strings

I took hold of his sleeve with my hand
And as if it were planned

And yet you'll never know the thrill of loving you.

When it is you I`m kissing,
I pity you constantly ,
You don't know what your missing for your only kissing poor me 
Poor you, you live your whole life through
And never know what loving you can be",Poor You
Judy Garland,"Never could carry a tune, never knew where to start
You came along when everything was wrong and put a song in my heart

Dear when you smiled at me, I heard a melody
It haunted me from the start
Something inside of me started a symphony
Zing! Went the strings of my heart

'Twas like a breath of spring, I heard a robin sing
About a nest set apart
All nature seemed to be in perfect harmony
Zing! Went the strings of my heart

Your eyes made skies seem blue again
What else could I do again
But keep repeating through and through
""I love you, love you""

I still recall the thrill, guess I always will
I hope 'twill never depart
Dear, with your lips to mine, a rhapsody divine
Zing! Went the strings of my heart

Judy Garland,"A lady known as Paris, Romantic and Charming
Has left her old companions and faded from view

Lonely men with lonely eyes are seeking her in vain
Her streets are where they were, but there's no sign of her

She has left the Seine

The last time I saw Paris, her heart was warm and gay,
I heard the laughter of her heart in every street cafÃƒÂ¢??

The last time I saw Paris, her trees were dressed for spring,
And lovers walked beneath those trees and birds found songs to sing.

I dodged the same old taxicabs that I had dodged for years.
The chorus of their squeaky horns was music to my ears.

The last time I saw Paris, her heart was warm and gay,
No matter how they change her, I'll remember her that way.

I'll think of happy hours, and people who shared them
Old women, selling flowers, in markets at dawn

Children who applauded, Punch and Judy in the park
And those who danced at night and kept our Paris bright

'Til the town went dark.",The Last Time I Saw Paris
Judy Garland,"Why do stage struck maidens clamor
To be actin' in the drammer?

We've heard say
You are gay
Night and day.

Oh, go 'way!

We drink water from a dipper,
You drink champagne from a slipper.

Tho' it seems cruel to bust
All your dreams,
Still I must;
Here's the truth I tell you:
Life upon the wicked stage
Ain't ever what a girl supposes;
Stage door Johnnies aren't raging
Over you with gems and roses.
When you let a feller hold your hand (which
means an extra beer or sandwich),
Ev'rybody whispers: ""Ain't her life a whirl?""
Though you're warned against a ""rout""
Ruining your reputation,
I have played around
The one night trade around
A great big nation:
Wild old men who give you jewels and sables
Only live in Aesop's Fables.
Life upon the wicked stage
Ain't nothin' for a girl.

Though we've listened to you moan and grieve, you
Must pardon us if we do not believe you,
There is no doubt
You're crazy about
Your awful stage!

I admit it's fun
To smear my face with paint,
Causing ev'ryone
To think I'm what I ain't,
And I like to play a demi-mondy role
With soul!
Ask the hero does he
Like the way I lure
When I play a hussy
Or a paramour,
Yet when once the curtain's down
My life is pure,
And how I dread it!

Life upon the wicked stage
Ain't ever what a girl supposes,
Stage door Johnnies aren't raging
Over you with gems and roses.

If some gentleman would talk with reason
I would cancel all next season.
Life upon the wicked stage
Ain't nothin' for a girl!

You'd be back the season after!",Life upon the Wicked Stage

Judy Garland,"I was a stranger in the city 
Out of town were the people I knew 
I had that feeling of self-pity 
What to do? What to do? What to do? 
The outlook was decidedly blue 
But as I walked through the foggy streets alone 
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

[Chorus]
A foggy day in London Town 
Had me low and had me down 
I viewed the morning with alarm 
The British Museum had lost its charm 
How long, I wondered, could this thing last? 
But the age of miracles hadn't passed, 
For, suddenly, I saw you there 
And through foggy London Town 
The sun was shining everywhere.",A Foggy Day (In London Town)

Judy Garland,"Did y'ever wake up in the morning
And grumble as you tumble out of bed?
You stub your toe, ouch!
You hit your elbow, ooh!
You bump your head, oh!
You step on a tack and you let out a howl,
There's soap in your eyes and you can't find the towel!
You try to comb your hair but can't arrange it,
Spill orange juice on your dress and have to change it!
Then all day long,
Everything you touch goes wrong!

Teacher told us, when this happens, never to whine or wail;
The same thing happens in life, but on a much larger scale!

It never rains but what it pours;
If lady luck should happen to desert you,
A bit of rain is never gonna hurt you,
So wait and the skies will all be blue.

It never rains but what it pours;
So what if all your troubles come in bunches,
Keep sticking to your silly little hunches,
And the sun will come shining through.

Bide your time and keep on hummin',
Don't you frown and sit around and weep.
Wait your turn, your day is comin',
And you'll be there on top of the heap!

It never rains but what it pours;
You may as well get all your worries over,
From then on you're gonna be in clover!
Smile when you should cry,
For every cloud there'll be a rainbow,
There'll be a sunbeam for every raindrop by and by!","It Never Rains, But It Pours"

Some folks have one, some folks have none
And I was alone for years, but fate was kind
And in the end, sent me a friend
Although he's not much higher than my knee
Still he's the greatest thing on earth to me

Dirty hands, dirty face
Leads the neighbours a chase
But his smile is as cute as can be
Making noise, breaking toys
He's always fighting the boys
But his eyes, they're a vision to see

And when my work is done
Coming home from the setting sun
To the gate he will start to run
And then I'll kiss my boy

Little devil, that's what they say
But to me he's an angel of joy

And trouble begins to brew,
Whenever the Winter winds become too strong,
I concentrate on you.

When fortune cries ""Nay! Nay!"" to me
And people declare ""You're through!"",
Whenever the blues become my only song,
I concentrate on you.

On your smile so sweet, so tender,
When at first your kiss I decline.
On the light in your eyes when I surrender,

I concentrate on you.",I Concentrate on You

Will your answer really change things

I'm afraid some day you'll leave me,
Saying ""can't we still be friends""

Judy Garland,"Now gather round you sailor boys, and listen to my plea
And when you've heard my tale you'll pity me
For I was a real damned fool in the port of Liverpool
The first time that I came home from the sea

I was paid off at the Home, from a voyage to Sierra Leone
Two pounds ten and sixpence was my pay
When I drew the tin I grinned, but I very soon got skinned
By a girl by the name of Maggie May

Oh, Maggie, Maggie May, they've taken you away
They've sent you to Van Diemen's cruel shore
For you robbed so many a sailor, and skinned so many a whaler
And you'll never shine in Paradise Street no more

I shan't forget the day when I first met Maggie May
She was cruising up and down on Canning Place
With a figure so divine, like a frigate of the line
So, being a sailor, I gave chase

Oh, Maggie, Maggie May, they've taken you away
They've sent you to Van Diemen's cruel shore
For you robbed so many a sailor, and skinned so many a whaler
And you'll never shine in Paradise Street no more

Next day I woke in bed, with a sore and aching head
No shoes, or shirt, or trousers could I find
I asked her where they were, and she answered, ""My dear sir,
They're down in Kelly's knock-shop, number nine""

Oh, Maggie, Maggie May, they've taken you away
They've sent you to Van Diemen's cruel shore
For you robbed so many a sailor, and skinned so many a whaler
And you'll never shine in Paradise Street no more

Oh, you thieving Maggie May, you robbed me of my pay
When I slept with you last night ashore
And the judge he guilty found her of robbing a homeward-bounder
And she'll never roam down Paradise Street no more

Oh, Maggie, Maggie May, they've taken you away
They've sent you to Van Diemen's cruel shore

Ran into Mllicent Palmer, you know Millicent Palmer,
A very dear friend of mine.

How do I get involved?

Well we walked around the corner for what passes
For a millinery shop and she looked in the window and
Saw my hat and said, ""that is for you""

Terrific wind blowing, couldn't drop a single putt, it was murder

In the way he works his dream off

That I like to get my kind of steam off

Doves coo, coo, ah, how I

I could go on singing till the cows come home
And the rooster starts to crow, crow, crow

When I see your eyes, I go all out
I must vocalize till you shout, ""Enough already""

Judy Garland,"Wherever we go, whatever we do,
We're gonna go through it together.
We may not go far, but sure as a star,
Wherever we are, it's together.

Wherever I go I know he goes.
Wherever I go I know she goes.
No fits, no fights, no feuds
And no egos, Amigos, together!

Through thick and through thin,
All out or all in.
And whether it's win, place or show.
With you for me and me for you,
We'll muddle through whatever we do.
Together, wherever we go.

Wherever we go, whatever we do,
We're gonna go through it together.
Wherever we sleep, if prices are steep,
We'll always sleep cheaper together.

Whatever the boat I row, you row.
A duo
Whatever the row I hoe, you hoe.
A trio.
And any I. O. U., I owe you-oh's?
Who, me-oh? No, you-oh.
No, we-oh.
Together!

We all take the bow
Including the cow,
Though business is lousy and slow.
With Herbie's vim, Louise's verve,
Now all we need is someone with nerve.
Together

Together, wherever,

Judy Garland,"Let me sigh, let me cry when I'm blue
Let me go 'way from this lonely town
Won't be long till my song will be true
'Cause I know I'm on my last go round

All the love I could steal, beg, or borrow
Wouldn't heal all this pain in my soul
What is love but a cradle to sorrow
With a heartbreak ahead for your goal

here I go
Now I know why I'm leaving
Got the blues
How can I lose?
Goodbye",Blue Prelude
Judy Garland,"You really shouldn't have done it,
You hadn't any right.
I really shouldn't have let you kiss me.
And although it was wrong,
I never was strong.
So as long as you've begun it,
And you know you shouldn't have done it,

Oh, do it again.
I may cry no, no, no, no, no, but do it again.
My lips just ache to have you take
The kiss that's waiting for you.
You know if you do you won't regret it.
Come and get it.

Oh, no one is near,
I may cry oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, but no one can hear.
Mama may scold me 'cause she told me
It was naughty but then, please, do it again.
Yes do it again, and again and again and again and again.

Turn out the light.
And hold me close in your arms
All through the night.
I know tomorrow morning
You will say goodbye and amen.
But until then, please do it again.","Do It Again!, song (interpolated into The French Doll)"
Judy Garland,"The snow makes teardrops on my window
The wind blows memories through my hall
And I am all alone on New Year's eve 
The time I need you most of all

The gay ones don their silly paper hats 
And blow their stupid little horns
At midnight they will all be singing Auld Lang Syne 
But the sad ones sit alone before the fire and sip a glass of lonely wine

I wish you a Happy New Year darling 
May your new love be bright and fair
I hope he'll do those special things for you 
That I would do if I were there.

I love the days we spent together
Before the old year lost it's shine
I'll keep that memory locked within my heart
That Happy New Year you were mine",Happy New Year
Judy Garland,"Wonderful pals are always hard to find
Some folks have one, some folks have none
And I was alone for years, but fate was kind
And in the end, sent me a friend
Although he's not much higher than my knee
Still he's the greatest thing on earth to me

Dirty hands, dirty face
Leads the neighbours a chase
But his smile is as cute as can be
Making noise, breaking toys
He's always fighting the boys
But his eyes, they're a vision to see

And when my work is done
Coming home from the setting sun
To the gate he will start to run
And then I'll kiss my boy

Dirty hands, dirty face
Little devil, that's what they say
But to me he's an angel of joy

Dirty hands, dirty face
Leads the neighbours a chase
But his smile, his little smile, is as cute as can be

And they're a vision to me

And when my work is done

Easter morning,
And my heart beat fast as I came through the door for:

In your Easter bonnet with all the frills upon it,
You'll be the grandest lady in the Easter Parade. 
I'll be all in clover, and when they look you over
I'll be the proudest fellow in the Easter Parade.
On the Avenue, Fifth Avenue,

The photographers will snap us
And you'll find that you're in the rotogravure.
Oh, I could write a sonnet about your Easter bonnet
And of the girl I'm taking to the Easter Parade.

Who, stole my heart away 
Who, makes me dream all day 
Dreams I know can never come true 
Seems as though I'll ever be blue 
Who, means my happiness 
Who, would I answer yes to 
No one, but you! 

A woman's intentions, her famine inventions 
A seldom if ever defined 
And I am no different, why should I be different? 
I simply can't make up my mind 
How can I solve this situation 
Except by the process of elimination

Can it be, can it be, who can it be? 
You'll never guess who has stolen my heart away Dreamin' dreams I know

With a doll of a dove,
He is out all night coo-cooin'!
When an owls on the prowl
For a feminine fowl,
He goes out all night woo-wooin!
Every bird and bee
Has his lunacy
In the way he works his dream off,
But when I feel high,
Here's the way that I
Like to let my kind of steam off!

Owls woo-woo,
Others sigh,
Doves coo-coo,
Ah, but I;

Judy Garland,"I've been running through rains
And the wind that follows after
For one certain face
And an unforgotten laughter

I've been following signs
I've been searching through the lands
For a certain pair of arms
And a certain pair of hands

Yes, I tried a kiss here
And I tried a kiss there
For when you're out in company
The boys and girls will pair

But it never was you
It never was anywhere you
An occasional sunset reminded me
Or a flower hanging high on a julep tree

Or one red star hung low in the west
Or a heart-break call from a Meadow Lark's nest
Made me think for a moment, maybe, it's true
I found him in the star, in the call, in the blue

But it never was you
It never was anywhere you
Anywhere, anywhere you",It Never Was You [From I Could Go on Singing]
Judy Garland,"Did y'ever wake up in the morning
And grumble as you tumble out of bed?
You stub your toe, ouch!
You hit your elbow, ooh!
You bump your head, ohh!
You step on a tack and you let out a howl,
There's soap in your eyes and you can't find the towel!
You try to comb your hair but can't arrange it,
Spill orange juice on your dress and have to change it!
Then all day long,
Everything you touch goes wrong!

Teacher told us, when this happens, never to whine or wail;
The same thing happens in life, but on a much larger scale!

It never rains but what it pours;
If lady luck should happen to desert you,
A bit of rain is never gonna hurt you,
So wait and the skies will all be blue.

It never rains but what it pours;
So what if all your troubles come in bunches,
Keep sticking to your silly little hunches,
And the sun will come shining through.

Bide your time and keep on hummin',
Don't you frown and sit around and weep.
Wait your turn, your day is comin',
And you'll be there on top of the heap!

It never rains but what it pours;
You may as well get all your worries over,
From then on you're gonna be in clover!

For every cloud there'll be a rainbow,
There'll be a sunbeam for every raindrop by and by!",It Never Rains But What It Pours
Judy Garland,"You have the cool clear eyes of a seeker of wisdom and truth,
Yet there's the upturned chin and the grin of impetuous youth;
Oh, I believe in you,
I believe in you!

I hear the sound of good solid judgment whenever you talk,
Yet there's that bold brave spring of the tiger that quickens your walk;
Oh, I believe in you,
I believe in you!

And when my faith in my fellow man all but falls apart,
I've got to feel your hand grasping mine and I take heart,
I take heart!

Yet there's that slam bang tang reminiscent of gin and vermouth;

And North and South, their both the best
But I only want go there as a guest

I love the rocks and what is more
With you there, they'd never be a bore
Cause I love being here with you

Life is such a breezy game
Love all kinds of weather, long as we're together

I love good wine and fine cuisine
And candle light, I like the scene
But baby if you know what I mean
I love being here with you
I love being here with you

I like a dance by Fred Astaire
And Brando's eyes, Yul Brynner's hair
But I think to tell you's only fair
That I love being here with you

And Cary Grant, oh do-dah-day
His utter charm takes me away
But don't get me wrong, how do you say
I love being here with you

Because there's something else, you know
They know how to say it, they know how to play it
They wind it up and let it go

That thrills and delights me, oh no 
It's just the nearness of you 

It isn't your sweet conversation 
That brings this sensation, oh no 
It's just the nearness of you 

When you're in my arms and I feel you so close to me 
All my wildest dreams come true 

I need no soft lights to enchant me 
If you'll only grant me the right 
To hold you ever so tight 
And to feel in the night the nearness of you",The Nearness of You

With so many rooms I couldn't count them all!

And who would think the man I loved was quite so handsome,
Quite so tall?
